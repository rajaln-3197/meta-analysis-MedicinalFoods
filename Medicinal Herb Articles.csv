rhodiola rosea,"Plant-based medicines for anxiety disorders, part 2: a review of clinical studies with supporting preclinical evidence - PubMed","              Research in the area of herbal psychopharmacology has revealed a variety of promising medicines that may provide benefit in the treatment of general anxiety and specific anxiety disorders. However, a comprehensive review of plant-based anxiolytics has been absent to date. Thus, our aim was to provide a comprehensive narrative review of plant-based medicines that have clinical and/or preclinical evidence of anxiolytic activity. We present the article in two parts. In part one, we reviewed herbal medicines for which only preclinical investigations for anxiolytic activity have been performed. In this current article (part two), we review herbal medicines for which there have been both preclinical and clinical investigations of anxiolytic activity. A search of MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, Scopus and the Cochrane Library databases was conducted (up to 28 October 2012) for English language papers using the search terms 'anxiety' OR 'anxiety disorder' OR 'generalized anxiety disorder' OR 'social phobia' OR 'post-traumatic stress disorder' OR 'panic disorder' OR 'agoraphobia' OR 'obsessive compulsive disorder' in combination with the search terms 'Herb*' OR 'Medicinal Plants' OR 'Botanical Medicine' OR 'Chinese herb*', in addition to individual herbal medicines. This search of the literature revealed 1,525 papers, of which 53 plants were included in the review (having at least one study using the whole plant extract). Of these plants, 21 had human clinical trial evidence (reviewed here in part two), with the other 32 having solely preclinical evidence (reviewed in part one). Support for efficacy was found for chronic use (i.e. greater than one day) of the following herbs in treating a range of anxiety disorders in human clinical trials: Piper methysticum, Matricaria recutita, Ginkgo biloba, Scutellaria lateriflora, Silybum marianum, Passiflora incarnata, Withania somniferum, Galphimia glauca, Centella asiatica, Rhodiola rosea, Echinacea spp., Melissa officinalis and Echium amoenum. For several of the plants studied, conclusions need to be tempered due to methodological issues such as small sample sizes, brief intervention durations and non-replication. Current evidence does not support Hypericum perforatum or Valeriana spp. for any anxiety disorder. Acute anxiolytic activity was found for Centella asiatica, Salvia spp., Melissa officinalis, Passiflora incarnata and Citrus aurantium. Bacopa monnieri has shown anxiolytic effects in people with cognitive decline. The therapeutic application of psychotropic plant-based treatments for anxiety disorders is also discussed, specifically Psychotria viridis and Banisteriopsis caarti (ayahuasca), Psilocybe spp. and cannabidiol-enriched (low tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC)) Cannabis spp.          "
rhodiola rosea,[Effects of rhodiola rosea on oxidative stress and negative emotional states in patients with obstructive sleep apnea] - PubMed,"Objective:The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of rhodiola rosea on oxidative stress, anxiety and depression in patients with OSA. Method:Ninety patients with moderate and severe OSA patients with negative emotions diagnosed by PSG, self-rating depression scale （SDS） and self-rating anxiety scale （SAS） were selected from the respiratory department of our hospital from February 2015 to February 2018. According to the random number table method, the patients were randomly divided into non-invasive ventilator group, rhodiola rosea+non-invasive ventilator group and rhodiola rosea group, with 30 cases in each group. Patients in the non-invasive ventilator group were treated with continuous positive airway pressure （CPAP） for 3 months, and those in the rhodiola rosea+non-invasive ventilator group were treated with oral rhodiola capsules for 3 months on the basis of CPAP, and those in the rhodiola rosea treatment group were treated with pure oral rhodiola capsules for 3 months. The changes of SDS and SAS before and after the three groups were compared, and the changes of serum SOD and MDA were detected by immunoenzyme-linked adsorption for comparative analysis. Result:There were no significant differences in SDS and SAS scores between the three groups （P>0.05）. SDS and SAS scores of patients in the rhodiola rosea+non-invasive ventilator group decreased after treatment （P<0.05） compared with those in the non-invasive ventilator group. SDS and SAS scores of patients in the rhodiola treatment group increased after treatment （P<0.05）. Compared with those in the rhodiola treatment group, SDS and SAS scores of patients in the rhodiola+non-invasive breathing group decreased after treatment （P<0.05）. Three group patients were no significant difference in serum SOD and malondialdehyde （MDA） before treatment （P>0.05）. Compared with before treatment, serum SOD level were all increased and MDA level were all decreased in the three groups after treatment （P<0.05）. Compared with noninvasive breathing unit after treatment, rhodiola+noninvasive breathing unit after treatment in patients with elevated levels of serum SOD, MDA level decreased （P<0.05）, and for the treatment group after treatment in patients with serum SOD levels drop, the MDA levels （P<0.05）, and the after rhodiola rosea treatment group compared, rhodiola+noninvasive breathing unit after treatment in patients with elevated levels of serum SOD, MDA level decreased （P<0.05）. Conclusion:Rhodiola may improve the negative emotions such as anxiety and depression by inhibiting oxygen free radicals and lipid peroxidation in patients with OSA.          "
rhodiola rosea,"Potential Antidepressant Effects of Scutellaria baicalensis, Hericium erinaceus and Rhodiola rosea - PubMed","              Recent studies focused on the pharmacology and feasibility of herbal compounds as a potential strategy to target a variety of human diseases ranging from metabolic to brain disorders. Accordingly, bioactive ingredients which are found within a variety of herbal compounds are reported to produce both neuroprotective and psychotropic activities which may help to combat mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances and cognitive alterations. In the present manuscript, we focus on three herbs which appear effective in mitigating anxiety or depression with favourable risk-benefit profiles, namely Scutellaria baicalensis (S. baicalensis), Hericium erinaceus (H. erinaceus) and Rhodiola rosea (R. rosea). These three traditional folk medicinal herbs target the main biochemical events that are implicated in mental disorders, mimicking, to some extent, the mechanisms of action of conventional antidepressants and mood stabilizers with a wide margin of tolerability. In detail, they rescue alterations in neurotransmitter and neuro-endocrine systems, stimulate neurogenesis and the synthesis of neurotrophic factors, and they counteract oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. Albeit the encouraging results that emerge from both experimental and clinical evidence, further studies are needed to confirm and better understand the mental-health promoting, and specifically, the antidepressant effects of these herbs.

rhodiola rosea,"The Effects of Rhodiola rosea L. Extract on Anxiety, Stress, Cognition and Other Mood Symptoms - PubMed","              This trial evaluated the impact of a Rhodiola rosea L. extract on self-reported anxiety, stress, cognition, and other mood symptoms. Eighty mildly anxious participants were randomized into two different groups of either Rhodiola rosea L (2 × 200 mg dose Vitano®, 1 tablet taken before breakfast and 1tablet before lunch) or a control condition (no treatment). Self-report measures and cognitive tests were completed at four testing sessions over a period of 14 days. Relative to the controls, the experimental group demonstrated a significant reduction in self-reported, anxiety, stress, anger, confusion and depression at 14 days and a significant improvements in total mood. No relevant differences in cognitive performance between the groups were observed. Rhodiola rosea L (Vitano®) presented a favourable safety tolerability profile. Although this was a non-placebo controlled trial, it is unlikely that the findings were the result of placebo effects as changes appeared gradual and were specific to certain psychological measures. However, we cannot determine a causal relationship; further investigations are recommended to support the effects of Rhodiola rosea L. extract on stress related symptoms.          "

rhodiola rosea,The authenticity and quality of Rhodiola rosea products - PubMed,"        Background:                    Rhodiola rosea L. Crassulaceae, root (Golden Root, Arctic Root) is a high-value herbal medicinal product, registered in the UK for the treatment of stress-induced fatigue, exhaustion and anxiety based on traditional use and used throughout Europe as a herbal medicinal product for similar indications. Numerous unregistered supplements are also available. There are several Chinese species used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), including Rhodiola crenulata (Hook.f. & Thomoson) that is believed to be a common adulterant in the R. rosea value chain.                  Aims:                    The project is embedded in a larger study aiming to investigate the diverse value chains that lead to the production of R. rosea as an herbal medicinal product or supplement. Here we focus on a comparison of the quality of the finished products and assess any phytochemical variation between products registered under the Traditional Herbal Medicine Products Directive (THMPD) and products obtained from the market without any registration (i.e. generally unlicensed supplements). Our key aim is to establish the extent of the problem in terms of adulteration of consumer products claiming to contain R. rosea (or R. crenulata).                  Methods:                    Approximately 40 commercial products (granulated powders and extracts) were sourced from different suppliers. We analysed these samples using high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC), mass spectrometry (MS) and (1)H NMR spectroscopy coupled with multi-variate analysis software following a method previously developed by our group for the analysis of turmeric products.                  Results:                    We investigate the phytochemistry of the different species and assess the potential of R. crenulata as an adulterant at the end of the R. rosea value chains. The consistency of the products varies significantly. Approximately one fifth of commercial products that claimed to be R. rosea did not contain rosavin (the key reference markers used to distinguish R. rosea from related species). Moreover some products appeared not to contain salidroside, another marker compound found in other Rhodiola species. Approximately 80% of the remaining commercial products were lower in rosavin content than the registered products and appeared to be adulterated with other Rhodiola species.                  Conclusions:                    The variation in phytochemical constituents present in Rhodiola products available to European buyers via the internet and other sources is a major cause for concern. Adulteration with different species, and other sometimes unknown adulterants, appears to be commonplace. Good quality systems and manufacturing practices, including those required under the THMPD, enable consumers to have confidence that products are authentic and meet a high specification for quality and safety.

rhodiola rosea,Puerariae Radix Prevents Anxiety and Cognitive Deficits in Mice Under Oligomeric Aβ-Induced Stress - PubMed,"              To evaluate the therapeutic effects of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for Alzheimer's disease (AD), we evaluated five CHMs in oligomeric Aβ25-35-treated mouse primary hippocampal neuronal cultures. The aqueous extract from the root of Pueraria lobata (Puerariae Radix; PR) showed better neuroprotective effects than did the other four CHM aqueous extracts, including Gardenia jasminoides, Eleutherococcus senticosus, Rhodiola rosea, and Panax, in the primary culture treated with saline or oligomeric Aβ25-35. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effects of aqueous extract of PR were also better than its well-known active compound, puerarin, against the neurotoxicity of oligomeric Aβ25-35 in a primary culture. For in vivo experiments, C57BL/6J male mice that received direct infusion of soluble oligomeric Aβ25-35 into the bilateral hippocampal CA1 subregion were used as an alternative AD mouse model. The effects and molecular mechanisms of chronic systemic administration of PR aqueous extract were evaluated in the alternative AD model. PR aqueous extract prevented anxiety and cognitive impairment in mice associated with a decrease in the levels of Aβ deposition, tau protein phosphorylation, inflammation, loss of noradrenergic, and serotonergic neurons and an increase in the levels of synaptophysin and insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) against the toxicity of oligomeric Aβ25-35. Furthermore, no obvious damage to the liver and kidney was detected after chronic systemic administration of PR aqueous extract. Therefore, using PR could be a safer, more effective therapeutic strategy than using its active compound puerarin to prevent both cognitive and noncognitive dysfunction and related pathological features of AD.

vitamin B,Reorganization of supramammillary-hippocampal pathways in the rat pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy: evidence for axon terminal sprouting - PubMed,"              In mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), spontaneous seizures likely originate from a multi-structural epileptogenic zone, including several regions of the limbic system connected to the hippocampal formation. In this study, we investigate the structural connectivity between the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) and the dentate gyrus (DG) in the model of MTLE induced by pilocarpine in the rat. This hypothalamic nucleus, which provides major extracortical projections to the hippocampal formation, plays a key role in the regulation of several hippocampus-dependent activities, including theta rhythms, memory function and emotional behavior, such as stress and anxiety, functions that are known to be altered in MTLE. Our findings demonstrate a marked reorganization of DG afferents originating from the SuM in pilocarpine-treated rats. This reorganization, which starts during the latent period, is massive when animals become epileptic and continue to evolve during epilepsy. It is characterized by an aberrant distribution and an increased number of axon terminals from neurons of both lateral and medial regions of the SuM, invading the entire inner molecular layer of the DG. This reorganization, which reflects an axon terminal sprouting from SuM neurons, could contribute to trigger spontaneous seizures within an altered hippocampal intrinsic circuitry.           "
vitamin B,Effects of daily intake of yoghurt enriched with bioactive components on chronic stress responses: a double-blinded randomized controlled trial - PubMed,"              Chronic stress has a negative influence on health. The aim was to determine stress reducing effects of yoghurt enriched with bioactive components as compared to normal yoghurt. High-trait anxiety individuals (n = 67) aged 18-63 years participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded intervention with parallel groups. They received either yoghurt enriched with alpha-lactalbumin, casein tripeptides and B vitamins (active) or isoenergetic standard yoghurt (control). To detect changes in psychological and physiological stress, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Profile of Mood States, salivary cortisol, inflammatory markers, blood pressure, heart rate variability (HRV) and actigraphy were monitored. We observed higher ratings of vigor (p = 0.047) and reduced feeling of inefficiency (p = 0.048) in the active group. HRV (baseline adjusted mean 49.1 ± 2.3 ms) and recovery index (106.6 ± 33.4) were higher in the active group than in controls (42.5 ± 2.2 ms and 80.0 ± 29.3) (p = 0.046 and p = 0.02, respectively). In conclusion, daily intake of yoghurt enriched with bioactive components may aid in stress coping.          "
vitamin B,Audit of primary care and initial secondary care investigations set against RCOG guidelines as standard in cases of subfertility - PubMed,"              Subfertility affects one in seven couples in the United Kingdom and is associated with considerable patient stress and anxiety. The RCOG, with the publication of the evidence-based guidelines, gives us clear recommendations on the initial investigation of the infertile couple. Against these guidelines we audited patient care over a period of 5 months in a dedicated consultant-led infertility clinic. Our results show that a considerable number of patients failed to have the correct advice clearly documented, and the initial primary care investigations of mid-luteal progesterone and semen analysis were performed correctly with results available in only 33% and 2% of occasions, respectively. There were, however, areas where the guidelines were adhered to very efficiently. To improve care we recommend the use of an infertility referral form for use in primary care upon which the practitioners can fill in the appropriate details and be guided on the necessary investigations.

vitamin B,Cobalamin level is related to self-reported and clinically rated mood and to syndromal depression in bereaved HIV-1(+) and HIV-1(-) homosexual men - PubMed,"        Objective:                    An examination of the relationship of plasma cobalamin (vitamin B(12)) level to overall psychological distress, specific mood states, and major depressive disorder was conducted in 159 bereaved men (90 HIV-1(+) and 69 HIV-1(-)).                  Methods:                    The relationship of a continuous measure of cobalamin level to psychological distress was examined, while controlling for HIV-1 serostatus, life stressors, social support, and coping styles.                  Results:                    Of this sample, 23.9% were either overtly or marginally cobalamin deficient; however, the deficiency rate was not significantly different by HIV-1 serostatus. Cobalamin level was inversely related to self-reported overall distress level and specifically to depression, anxiety, and confusion subscale scores, as well as to clinically rated depressed and anxious mood. Lower plasma cobalamin levels also were associated with the presence of symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder.                  Conclusion:                    These findings suggest that cobalamin level may be physiologically related to depressed and anxious mood level, as well as to syndromal depression.          "
vitamin B,"Exploring the Effect of Lactium™ and Zizyphus Complex on Sleep Quality: A Double-Blind, Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial - PubMed","              Acute, non-clinical insomnia is not uncommon. Sufferers commonly turn to short-term use of herbal supplements to alleviate the symptoms. This placebo-controlled, double-blind study investigated the efficacy of LZComplex3 (lactium™, Zizyphus, Humulus lupulus, magnesium and vitamin B6), in otherwise healthy adults with mild insomnia. After a 7-day single-blind placebo run-in, eligible volunteers (n = 171) were randomized (1:1) to receive daily treatment for 2 weeks with LZComplex3 or placebo. Results revealed that sleep quality measured by change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score improved in both the LZComplex3 and placebo groups. There were no significant between group differences between baseline and endpoint on the primary outcome. The majority of secondary outcomes, which included daytime functioning and physical fatigue, mood and anxiety, cognitive performance, and stress reactivity, showed similar improvements in the LZComplex3 and placebo groups. A similar proportion of participants reported adverse events (AEs) in both groups, with two of four treatment-related AEs in the LZComplex3 group resulting in permanent discontinuation. It currently cannot be concluded that administration of LZComplex3 for 2 weeks improves sleep quality, however, a marked placebo response (despite placebo run-in) and/or short duration of treatment may have masked a potential beneficial effect on sleep quality.

vitamin B,"Superiority of magnesium and vitamin B6 over magnesium alone on severe stress in healthy adults with low magnesemia: A randomized, single-blind clinical trial - PubMed","        Introduction:                    Animal and clinical studies suggest complementary effects of magnesium and high-dose pyridoxine (vitamin B6) on stress reduction. This is the first randomized trial evaluating the effects of combined magnesium and vitamin B6 supplementation on stress in a stressed population with low magnesemia using a validated measure of perceived stress.                  Methods:                    In this Phase IV, investigator-blinded trial (EudraCT: 2015-003749-24), healthy adults with Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-42) stress subscale score >18 and serum magnesium concentration 0.45 mmol/L-0.85 mmol/L, were randomized 1:1 to magnesium-vitamin B6 combination (Magne B6 [Mg-vitamin B6]; daily dose 300 mg and 30 mg, respectively) or magnesium alone (Magnespasmyl [Mg]; daily dose 300 mg). Outcomes included change in DASS-42 stress subscale score from baseline to Week 8 (primary endpoint) and Week 4, and incidence of adverse events (AEs).                  Results:                    In the modified intention-to-treat analysis (N = 264 subjects), both treatment arms substantially reduced DASS-42 stress subscale score from baseline to Week 8 (Mg-vitamin B6, 44.9%; Mg 42.4%); no statistical difference between arms was observed (p>0.05). An interaction (p = 0.0097) between baseline stress level and treatment warranted subgroup analysis (as per statistical plan); adults with severe/extremely severe stress (DASS-42 stress subscale score ≥25; N = 162) had a 24% greater improvement with Mg-vitamin B6 versus Mg at Week 8 (3.16 points, 95% CI 0.50 to 5.82, p = 0.0203). Consistent results were observed in the per protocol analysis and at Week 4. Overall, 12.1% of Mg-vitamin B6 treated and 17.4% of Mg-treated subjects experienced AEs potentially treatment related.                  Conclusions:                    These findings suggest oral Mg supplementation alleviated stress in healthy adults with low magnesemia and the addition of vitamin B6 to Mg was not superior to Mg supplementation alone. With regard to subjects with severe/extremely severe stress, this study provides clinical support for greater benefit of Mg combined with vitamin B6.          "

vitamin B,"Emotional distress and quality of life during folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin in colorectal cancer patients with and without chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: A cross-sectional study - PubMed","              When the 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) chemotherapy regimen is used to treat colorectal cancer (CRC), chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) caused by oxaliplatin can substantially affect quality of life (QOL) in the CRC patients. This study compared emotional distress and QOL during FOLFOX in CRC patients with and without CIPN symptoms.This cross-sectional, descriptive, and comparative study recruited 68 CRC patients receiving FOLFOX at a local teaching hospital and at a medical center in southern Taiwan. Self-reported structured questionnaires (oxaliplatin-associated neuropathy questionnaire, profile of mood states short form, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, Core 30, version 3.0) were used for 1-time data collection. The Chi-square test, Fisher exact test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to analyze data, and a P-value < .05 was considered statistically significant.The CIPN group had 45 (66.2%) patients, and the non-CIPN group had 23 (33.8%) patients. The 5 most common symptoms were coldness-related burning sensation or discomfort in the upper limbs, numbness in the upper limbs, tingling in the upper limbs, impairment of vision, and discomfort in the throat. The CIPN group had more females (P = .013), a more advanced stage of CRC (P = .04) and a higher chemotherapy dosage (P = .006). The 2 groups did not significantly differ in anxiety (P = .065) or depression (P = .135). Compared to the non-CIPN group, the CIPN group had significantly lower functioning (P = .001) and global health status (P < .001) and significantly more symptoms (P < .001).The CIPN group had significantly lower QOL compared to the non-CIPN group. However, the CIPN group did not have lower emotional distress compared to the non-CIPN group. The results of this study demonstrate the need for in-service courses specifically designed to train health professionals in assessing and managing CIPN symptoms to improve QOL in CRC patients receiving FOLFOX.

vitamin B,A.E. Bennett Research Award. Anatomic basis for differential regulation of the rostrolateral peri-locus coeruleus region by limbic afferents - PubMed,"        Background:                    Neurochemical and electrophysiological studies indicate that the locus coeruleus (LC)-norepinephrine system is activated by physiological and external stressors. This activation is mediated in part by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), the hypothalamic neurohormone that initiates the endocrine response to stress. We have previously shown that the central nucleus of the amygdala (CNA) provides CRF afferents to noradrenergic processes in the peri-LC area that may serve to integrate emotional and cognitive responses to stress. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) shares many anatomical and neurochemical characteristics with the CNA, including a high density of CRF-immunoreactive cells and fibers; however, recent studies have suggested that the CNA and the BNST may differentially regulate responses to conditioned and unconditioned fear, respectively, suggesting divergent neuroanatomical circuits underlying these processes.                  Methods:                    In the present study, neuroanatomical substrates subserving regulation of the LC by the BNST were examined. Anterograde tract-tracing was combined with immunoelectron microscopy to test the hypotheses that BNST efferents target noradrenergic neurons of the LC and that these efferents exhibit immunolabeling for CRF.                  Results:                    Ultrastructural analysis of sections that were dually labeled for the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) injected into the BNST and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactivity demonstrated that BDA-labeled axon terminals formed synaptic specializations (primarily inhibitory) with TH-labeled dendrites and dendrites that lacked TH immunoreactivity. In contrast to CNA efferents that exhibited substantial immunolabeling for CRF, far fewer BDA-labeled terminals from the BNST in the rostrolateral peri-LC contained CRF.                  Conclusions:                    The present results indicate that the BNST may provide distinct neurochemical regulation of the peri-LC as compared to other limbic afferents such as the CNA. These data are interesting in light of behavioral studies showing that the CNA and BNST may be differentially involved in fear versus anxiety, respectively.          "
vitamin B,Reversal of behavioral decline and neuropathology by a complex vitamin supplement involves modulation of key neurochemical stressors - PubMed,"              Metal ions are crucial for normal neurochemical signaling and perturbations in their homeostasis have been associated with neurodegenerative processes. Hypothesizing that in vivo modulation of key neurochemical processes including metal ion regulation (by transferrin receptor-1: TfR-1) in cells can improve disease outcome, we investigated the efficacy of a complex vitamin supplement (CVS) containing B-vitamins and ascorbic acid in preventing/reversing behavioral decline and neuropathology in rats. Wistar rats (eight weeks-old) were assigned into five groups (n = 8), including controls and those administered CVS (400 mg/kg/day) for two weeks before or after AlCl3 (100 mg/kg)-induced neurotoxicity. Following behavioral assessments, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus were prepared for biochemical analyses, histology and histochemistry. CVS significantly reversed reduction of exploratory/working memory, frontal-dependent motor deficits, cognitive decline, memory dysfunction and anxiety. These correlated with CVS-dependent modulation of TfP-1 expression that were accompanied by significant reversal of neural oxidative stress in expressed superoxide dismutase, nitric oxide, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and malondialdehyde. Furthermore, CVS inhibited neural bioenergetics dysfunction, with increased labelling of glucokinase within PFC and hippocampus correlating with increased glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and decreased lactate dehydrogenase expressions. These relates to inhibition of over-expressed acetylcholinesterase and increased total protein synthesis. Histological and Nissl staining of thin sections corroborated roles of CVS in reversing AlCl3-induced neuropathology. Summarily, we showed the role of CVS in normalizing important neurochemical molecules linking concurrent progression of oxidative stress, bioenergetics deficits, synaptic dysfunction and cellular hypertrophy during neurodegeneration.

vitamin B,"Comparison of myo-inositol and metformin on mental health parameters and biomarkers of oxidative stress in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial - PubMed","        Introduction:                    Data on comparison of myo-inositol and metformin on mental health parameters and biomarkers of oxidative stress in subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are scarce. This purpose of this study was to compare of myo-inositol and metformin on mental health parameters and biomarkers of oxidative stress in subjects with PCOS.                  Methods:                    This randomized controlled trial was conducted among 60 subjects diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria. Subjects were randomly assigned into two groups to intake either myo-inositol (n = 30) or metformin (n = 30) for 12 weeks. Parameters of mental health were recorded at baseline and after the 12-week intervention. Fasting blood samples were obtained at baseline and the end of the study to determine biomarkers of biomarkers of oxidative stress.                  Results:                    After the 12-week intervention, changes in beck depression inventory total score (-1.0 ± 1.7 vs. -0.3 ± 0.7, p = 0.03), general health questionnaire scores (-1.7 ± 2.9 vs. -0.5 ± 1.2, p = 0.02), depression anxiety and stress scale scores (-3.9 ± 6.4 vs. -0.9 ± 1.9, p = 0.01) and plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) concentrations (+106.1 ± 69.6 vs. +2.1 ± 132.4 mmol/L, p < 0.001) in the myo-inositol group were significantly different from the changes in these indicators in the metformin group. Myo-inositol supplementation for 12 weeks among patients with PCOS did not affect plasma glutathione and malondialdehyde levels.                  Conclusions:                    Overall, our data supported that myo-inositol supplementation for 12 weeks among patients with PCOS had favorable effects on parameters of mental health and plasma TAC levels.

vitamin B,A systematic review of the associations between maternal nutritional biomarkers and depression and/or anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum - PubMed,"        Background:                    Nutritional requirements need to be met in order to adapt to pre- and postnatal changes. Our aim was to systematically review the evidence of associations between nutritional biomarkers and psychological distress during pregnancy and in the first postnatal year.                  Methods:                    MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Scielo, LILACS, clinicaltrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched for articles from inception to 4/15/2016. Studies of maternal nutritional biomarkers in blood (fatty acids/micronutrients/amino acids) and associations with psychological distress (depression/anxiety/stress) were included. Two independent reviewers extracted data based on study designs, participants, outcomes, exposures, and association measures.                  Results:                    Thirty-eight studies were included. A total of 13 studies showed divergent or no associations between serum/plasma/erythrocyte fatty acid concentrations and depression/anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum. Changes in serum cholesterol levels from pregnancy to postpartum showed a significant inverse correlation with depression in one out of three studies. Five out of seven studies found an inverse association between serum vitamin D levels and pre- and postnatal depression. Plasma tryptophan levels were inversely correlated with postnatal depression scores in three out of four studies. We identified that one out of two studies presented no significant association between vitamin B12/folate/ferritin concentrations and depression in postpartum.                  Limitations:                    There was higher variability between association measures, time and scales of depression and anxiety assessments.                  Conclusions:                    The majority of high-quality studies suggest that lower vitamin D levels may be associated with postpartum depression. However, further evidence is needed for guiding clinical practice on nutritional biomarkers.          "
vitamin B,The effect of methylated vitamin B complex on depressive and anxiety symptoms and quality of life in adults with depression - PubMed,"              Depression, the most common type of mental illness, is the second leading cause of disability and is increasing among Americans. The effect of improved nutrition, particularly with dietary supplements, on depression may provide an alternative to standard medical treatment. Some studies have shown that certain nutrients (e.g., inositol and S-adenosyl methionine) are effective at improving depressed mood, although the results are not unequivocal. The current study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a vitamin B complex nutritional supplement (Max Stress B) for improving depressive and anxiety symptoms according to the Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories (BDI and BAI) in 60 adults diagnosed with major depression or other forms of depressive disorders. Secondary outcomes included quality of life according to the SF-36. Participants were assessed at baseline and 30- and 60-day followups. Max Stress B showed significant and more continuous improvements in depressive and anxiety symptoms, compared to placebo. Additionally, Max Stress B showed significant improvement on the mental health scale of the SF-36 compared to placebo. Thus, we showed modest utility of Max Stress B to improve mood symptoms and mental health quality of life in adults with depression.          "
vitamin B,Thiamine and benfotiamine improve cognition and ameliorate GSK-3β-associated stress-induced behaviours in mice - PubMed,"              Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency in the brain has been implicated in the development of dementia and symptoms of depression. Indirect evidence suggests that thiamine may contribute to these pathologies by controlling the activities of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β. While decreased GSK-3β activity appears to impair memory, increased GSK-3β activity is associated with the distressed/depressed state. However, hitherto direct evidence for the effects of thiamine on GSK-3β function has not been reported. Here, we administered thiamine or, the more bioavailable precursor, benfotiamine at 200mg/kg/day for 2weeks to C57BL/6J mice, to determine whether treatment might affect behaviours that are known to be sensitive to GSK-3β activity and whether such administration impacts on GSK-3β expression within the brain. The mice were tested in models of contextual conditioning and extinction, a 5-day rat exposure stress test, and a modified swim test with repeated testing. The tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (7.5mg/kg/day), was administered as a positive control for the effects of thiamine or benfotiamine. As for imipramine, both compounds inhibited the upregulation of GSK-3β induced by predator stress or repeated swimming, and reduced floating scores and the predator stress-induced behavioural changes in anxiety and exploration. Coincident, thiamine and benfotiamine improved learning and extinction of contextual fear, and the acquisition of the step-down avoidance task. Our data indicate that thiamine and benfotiamine have antidepressant/anti-stress effects in naïve animals that are associated with reduced GSK-3β expression and conditioning of adverse memories. Thus thiamine and benfotiamine may modulate GSK-3β functions in a manner that is dependent on whether the contextual conditioning is adaptive or maladaptive.          "
vitamin B,"Metabolic, idiosyncratic toxicity of drugs: overview of the hepatic toxicity induced by the anxiolytic, panadiplon - PubMed","              Preclinical drug safety evaluation studies, typically conducted in two or more animal species, reveal and define dose-dependent toxicities and undesirable effects related to pharmacological mechanism of action. Idiosyncratic toxic responses are often not detected during this phase in development due to their relative rarity in incidence and differences in species sensitivity. This paper reviews and discusses the metabolic idiosyncratic toxicity and species differences observed for the experimental non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic, panadiplon. This compound produced evidence of hepatic toxicity in Phase 1 clinical trial volunteers that was not predicted by rat, dog or monkey preclinical studies. However, subsequent studies in Dutch-belted rabbits revealed a hepatic toxic syndrome consistent with a Reye's Syndrome-like idiosyncratic response. Investigations into the mechanism of toxicity using rabbits and cultured hepatocytes from several species, including human, provided a sketch of the complex pathway required to produce hepatic injury. This pathway includes drug metabolism to a carboxylic acid metabolite (cyclopropane carboxylic acid), inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, and effects on intermediary metabolism including depletion of glycogen and disruption of glucose homeostasis. We also provide evidence suggesting that the carboxylic acid metabolite decreases the availability of liver CoA and carnitine secondary to the formation of unusual acyl derivatives. Hepatic toxicity could be ameliorated by administration of carnitine, and to a lesser extent by pantothenate. These hepatocellular pathway defects, though not directly resulting in cell death, rendered hepatocytes sensitive to secondary stress, which subsequently produced apoptosis and hepatocellular necrosis. Not all rabbits showed evidence of hepatic toxicity, suggesting that individual or species differences in any step along this pathway may account for idiosyncratic responses. These differences may be roughly applied to other metabolic idiosyncratic hepatotoxic responses and include variations in drug metabolism, effects on mitochondrial function, nutritional status, and health or underlying disease.

vitamin B,Plasma pyridoxine deficiency is related to increased psychological distress in recently bereaved homosexual men - PubMed,"        Objective:                    Previous research has demonstrated that a theoretical model including measures of life stressors, social support, and coping style significantly predicts psychological distress. This study tested plasma pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency status as a predictor of overall psychological distress and specific mood states in this model, controlling for HIV-1 serostatus.                  Method:                    Subjects included HIV-1+ (N = 76) and HIV-1- (N = 58) recently bereaved homosexual men. At baseline, subjects completed a battery of psychosocial questionnaires, together with a physical examination and venipuncture. The Profile of Mood States (POMS) provided measures of overall psychological distress as well as specific mood states. Pyridoxine deficiency status (a categorical measure of deficient vs. adequate status) was determined with a bioassay of erythrocyte aspartate aminotransferase activity.                  Results:                    Pyridoxine deficiency was a significant predictor of increased overall psychological distress in this model, controlling for life stressors, social support, coping style, and HIV-1 serostatus. In post hoc analyses of specific mood state effects, pyridoxine deficiency status was significantly associated with increases in depressed, fatigued, and confused mood levels, but not with those of anxiety, anger, or vigor.                  Discussion:                    These findings suggest that adequate pyridoxine status may be necessary to avert psychological distress in the setting of bereavement. Inasmuch as pyridoxine is a cofactor for 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase--an enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway of serotonin--serotonin level in the brain is implicated as the mediating factor.

vitamin B,"The impact of essential fatty acid, B vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium and zinc supplementation on stress levels in women: a systematic review - PubMed","        Background:                    Women juggling multiple roles in our complex society are increasingly experiencing psychological stress. Dietary supplementation to manage stress is widespread despite limited supporting evidence. A systematic review of the available literature was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of specific dietary supplements in managing female stress and anxiety.                  Objectives:                    To identify the impact of essential fatty acids (EFAs), B vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium and/or zinc, consumed as dietary supplements to the daily diet, on female stress and anxiety levels.                  Inclusion criteria types of participants:                    Women aged 18 years and over, who had participated in a study where stress and/or anxiety were assessed.                  Types of intervention(s):                    Dietary supplementation with EFAs, B vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium and/or zinc.                  Types of comparators:                    Supplements, either alone or combined, were compared with either no intervention or placebo.                  Types of studies:                    Randomized controlled and pseudo-randomized trials were included.                  Outcomes:                    Stress and anxiety were assessed using self-report or physiological outcome measures.                  Search strategy:                    Published and unpublished studies were sought via MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, MedNar, National Institute of Mental Health and the International Association for Women's Mental Health.                  Methodological quality:                    Methodological quality was evaluated using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute.                  Data extraction:                    Data were extracted using the standardized data extraction instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute.                  Data synthesis:                    Due to heterogeneity of the included studies, narrative synthesis was performed.                  Results:                    Fourteen studies were included in this review. Essential fatty acids were effective in reducing perceived stress and salivary cortisol levels during pregnancy and anxiety in premenstrual women, and anxiety during menopause in the absence of depression, but were ineffective when depression was disregarded. Disregarding the hormonal phase, EFAs were ineffective in reducing stress or anxiety in four groups of women. Combined magnesium and vitamin B6 supplementation reduced premenstrual anxiety but had no effect when used in isolation and did not affect stress in women suffering from dysmenorrhea when combined or used in isolation. Older women experienced anxiety reduction using vitamin B6, but not folate or vitamin B12. High-dose sustained-release vitamin C was effective in reducing anxiety and blood pressure in response to stress.                  Conclusion:                    The current review suggests that EFAs may be effective in reducing prenatal stress and salivary cortisol and may reduce anxiety during premenstrual syndrome and during menopause in the absence of depression. Magnesium and vitamin B6 may be effective in combination in reducing premenstrual stress, and vitamin B6 alone may reduce anxiety effectively in older women. High-dose sustained-release vitamin C may reduce anxiety and mitigate increased blood pressure in response to stress.                  Implications for practice:                    Essential fatty acids may be effective in reducing prenatal stress and salivary cortisol levels, and premenstrual or menopausal anxiety in the absence of depression. Combining magnesium and vitamin B6 may reduce premenstrual anxiety and vitamin B6 may reduce anxiety in older women. High-dose sustained-release vitamin C may reduce anxiety and mitigate increased blood pressure in response to stress.                  Implications for research:                    Investigating supplementation in longer term studies is warranted and should include compliance testing, the use of inert substances as controls and reliable outcome measures.

vitamin B,Emotional distress induced rhabdomyolysis in an individual with carnitine palmitoly-transferase deficiency - PubMed,"              A 48-year-old male patient with underlying CPT II enzyme deficiency is described. Emotional stress appeared to precipitate recurrent myalgias, rhabdomyolysis and reversible renal impairment over a 40-year period. Our search of the English literature indicates this to be the first time that the emotional stress has been documented to precipitate the CPT II syndrome. Although the pathogenesis of this syndrome has yet to be established, existing knowledge is briefly reviewed and the likely metabolic and neuroendocrine mechanisms which link emotional stress to muscle metabolism are examined. These mechanisms influence the extent of lipolysis or glycolysis that occurs during the process of muscle ATP generation. It is suggested that neuroendocrine and other stress related changes which favour lipolysis over glycolysis adversely affect muscle energy metabolism in patients whose mitochondria are deficient in CPT II enzyme. Possible treatment strategies are those that favour glycolysis over fatty acid metabolism and include a variety of ways of modulating sympathetic and parasympathetic tone. The use of carbohydrate supplementation beta-blockers and anxiolytic agents is discussed.          "
vitamin B,[Oxidative homeostasis and functional parameters of rats at high altitudes with alpha-lipoic acid correction] - PubMed,"              Oxidative and functional effects of alpha-lipoic acid (a-LA) were studied in the course of 45-day adaptation to high altitudes (3200 m in the Central Tien Shan, June - August). Comparison of a-LA with mildronate stated similarity of their antioxidant and membrane effects on the third (stable) phase of adaptation (day 45), as both substances demonstrated a distinct lyso-PL-limiting effect and did not change dramatically concentration of diene conjugates (primary products of lipid peroxidation) in brain tissue. a-LA surpassed mildronate in the rate of the compensating effect in respect of behavior disorders and anxiety in rats. Besides, the substances contributed equally to physical performance increment by the end of adaptation. The positive effect of a-LA on the functional characteristics was hand in hand with minimization of the consequences of oxidative stress. These experimental data imply that a-LA can be effective in controlling the long process of adaptation to high altitude conditions.          "

This disorder has a significant socio-economic impact as it worsens quality of life. There is either no or little data available in terms of the Indian context.                  Methods:                    Patients who presented with insomnia or leg pain were screened for Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) in the Psychiatry and Neurology departments of a tertiary care teaching institution from June 2011 to October 2011. One hundred consecutive patients diagnosed with RLS were included. Duration of symptoms, previous medical consultation history, and treatment received were scrutinized and recorded. Severity of RLS was assessed using the IRLS Hindi version. For statistical analysis, descriptive analysis and independent sample t-test were used.                  Results:                    Out of 653 subjects with insomnia or leg pain, 15.31% of the subjects had RLS. Females outnumbered males by a ratio of 2:1. Ninety-four percent of subjects had a moderate to very severe form of the illness. Only 32% of subjects reported leg symptoms to their physician on each visit. The rest of the patients sought an opinion for other symptoms like insomnia, daytime-fatigue, memory impairment, irritability, etc. Eighty percent of patients visited a general Physician or a primary care Physician. On average, five consultations were made before patients came to see us. None of the patients were diagnosed with RLS by any of their general Physicians or by specialists like neurologists, psychiatrists, etc. Common misdiagnoses (available in just 8% of cases) for legs symptoms were arthritis, calcium deficiency, worms in the stomach, depression, anxiety, stress, and vitamin deficiency. All the patients were prescribed medicines. Benzodiazepines were the most frequently prescribed drugs (97%), followed by injectable vitamin B-Complex (95% cases), calcium tablets (62% cases), selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors (30%), and tri-cyclic antidepressants (25%). Proton pump inhibitors or NSAIDs were prescribed to almost all the patients along with previously mentioned drugs.                  Conclusion:                    Diagnosis of RLS was missed not only by general physicians, but also by specialists like neurologists and psychiatrists. Most of the time diagnosis could not be established, yet medicines were prescribed. Many of these medicines were either ineffective or deleterious to RLS.          "

vitamin B,Alterations in hippocampal serotonergic and INSR function in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats exposed to stress: neuroprotective role of pyridoxine and Aegle marmelose - PubMed,"              Diabetes and stress stimulate hippocampal 5-HT synthesis, metabolism and release. The present study was carried out to find the effects of insulin, Aegle marmelose alone and in combination with pyridoxine on the hippocampal 5-HT, 5-HT(2A) receptor subtype, gene expression studies on 5-HT(2A), 5-HTT, INSR, immunohistochemical studies and elevated plus maze in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. 5-HT content showed a significant decrease (p < 0.001) and a significant increase (p < 0.001) in 5-HIAA in hippocampus of diabetic rats compared to control. 5-HT receptor binding parameters B(max) and Kd showed a significant decrease (p < 0.001) whereas 5-HT(2A) receptor binding parameters Bmax showed a significant decrease (p < 0.001) with a significant increase (p < 0.05) in Kd in hippocampus of diabetic rats compared to control. Gene expression studies of 5-HT(2A), 5-HTT and INSR in hippocampus showed a significant down regulation (p < 0.001) in diabetic rats compared to control. Pyridoxine treated in combination with insulin and A. marmelose to diabetic rats reversed the 5-HT content, B(max), Kd of 5-HT, 5-HT(2A) and gene expression of 5-HT(2A), 5-HTT and INSR in hippocampus to near control. The gene expression of 5-HT(2A) and 5-HTT were confirmed by immunohistochemical studies. Behavioural studies using elevated plus maze showed that serotonin through its transporter significantly increased (p < 0.001) anxiety-related traits in diabetic rats which were corrected by combination therapy. Our results suggest that pyridoxine treated in combination with insulin and A. marmelose has a role in the regulation of insulin synthesis and release, normalising diabetic related stress and anxiety through hippocampal serotonergic function. This has clinical significance in the management of diabetes.          "
vitamin B,Brain antioxidant effect of mirtazapine and reversal of sedation by its combination with alpha-lipoic acid in a model of depression induced by corticosterone - PubMed,"        Background:                    Depression is accompanied by activated neuro-oxidative and neuro-nitrosative pathways, while targeting these pathways has clinical efficacy in depression. This study aimed to investigate the effects of mirtazapine (MIRT) alone and combined with alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) against corticosterone (CORT) induced behavioral and oxidative alterations.                  Methods:                    Male mice received vehicle or CORT 20mg/kg during 14 days. From the 15th to 21st days they were divided in groups administered: vehicle, MIRT 3mg/kg or the combinations MIRT+ALA100 or MIRT+ALA200. On the 21st day of treatment, the animals were subjected to behavioral tests. Twenty-four hours after the last drug administration hippocampus (HC) and striatum (ST) were dissected for the determination reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (LP) and nitrite levels.                  Results:                    CORT induced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors as observed by increased immobility time in the tail suspension test and decreased sucrose consumption. MIRT or MIRT+ALA are effective in reversing anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors induced by CORT. CORT and MIRT alone prolonged sleeping time and this effect was reversed by MIRT+ALA. CORT significantly increased LP, which was reversed by MIRT or MIRT+ALA. Nitrite levels were increased in CORT-treated animals and reversed by MIRT+ALA200 (HC), MIRT or MIRT+ALA (ST).                  Limitation:                    A relative small sample size and lack of a washout period between drug administration and behavioral testing.                  Conclusions:                    MIRT or MIRT+ALA reverse CORT-induced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors probably via their central antioxidant effects. Augmentation of MIRT with ALA may reverse sedation, an important side effect of MIRT. Randomized controlled studies are needed to examine the clinical efficacy of this combination in human depression.          "

Methods:                    A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of patients allocated to receive either fluoxetine (FLX) or folic acid (FA). Anxiety state was assessed at the beginning of ovarian stimulation (OS), ovum pick-up, embryo transfer, and on the day of the pregnancy test (DPT) using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).                  Results:                    Baseline STAI-S and STAI-T were normal. From OS to DPT, STAI-S increased from 42.8+/-10.6 to 44+/-9.0 in the FLX group and from 40.9+/-8.1 to 45.3+/-8.3 in the FA group (P=0.03 and P=0.001, respectively). IVF outcome was not affected by the treatment in the two groups.                  Conclusions:                    Caution is needed in prescribing fluoxetine to alleviate anxiety in patients undergoing IVF. Studies are needed to determine whether other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or higher fluoxetine doses can relieve emotional distress without affecting IVF outcome.          "
vitamin B,"Maternal Nicotinamide Riboside Enhances Postpartum Weight Loss, Juvenile Offspring Development, and Neurogenesis of Adult Offspring - PubMed","              Conditions of metabolic stress dysregulate the NAD metabolome. By restoring NAD, nicotinamide riboside (NR) provides resistance to such conditions. We tested the hypotheses that postpartum might dysregulate maternal NAD and that increasing systemic NAD with NR might benefit mothers and offspring. In postpartum mothers, the liver NAD metabolome is depressed while blood increases circulation of NAD metabolites to enable a >20-fold increase in mammary NAD+ and NADP+. Lactation and NR synergize in stimulating prolactin synthesis and mammary biosynthetic programs. NR supplementation of new mothers increases lactation and nursing behaviors and stimulates maternal transmission of macronutrients, micronutrients, and BDNF into milk. Pups of NR-supplemented mothers are advantaged in glycemic control, size at weaning, and synaptic pruning. Adult offspring of mothers supplemented during nursing retain advantages in physical performance, anti-anxiety, spatial memory, delayed onset of behavioral immobility, and promotion of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Thus, postgestational maternal micronutrition confers lasting advantages to offspring.          "
vitamin B,The effect of 90 day administration of a high dose vitamin B-complex on work stress - PubMed,"        Objective:                    Occupational stress is increasing in Western societies and the impact is significant at a personal, organisational and community level. The present study examined for the first time the efficacy of 3 months administration of two forms of high dose vitamin B complex on mood and psychological strain associated with chronic work stress.                  Method:                    Sixty participants completed the 3-month, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in which personality, work demands, mood, anxiety and strain were assessed.                  Results:                    After individual differences in personality and work demands were statistically controlled, the vitamin B complex treatment groups reported significantly lower personal strain and a reduction in confusion and depressed/dejected mood after 12 weeks. There were no treatment-related changes in other measures of mood and anxiety.                  Discussion:                    The results of the study are consistent with two previous studies examining multivitamin supplementation and personal (non-work) feelings of strain and suggestive of significant decreases in the experience of workplace stress after 90 day supplementation of a B multivitamin.                  Conclusion:                    Given the direct and indirect costs of workplace stress, these findings point to the utility of a cost-effective treatment for the mood and psychological strain effects of occupational stress. These findings may have important personal health, organisational and societal outcomes given the rising cost and incidence of workplace stress.          "
vitamin B,Antidepressant- and anticompulsive-like effects of purinergic receptor blockade: involvement of nitric oxide - PubMed,"              Activation of purinergic receptors by ATP (P2R) modulates glutamate release and the activation of post-synaptic P2R is speculated to induce nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. Increased glutamatergic and nitrergic signaling have been involved in the neurobiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test the effects of two P2R antagonists (PPADS and iso-PPADS) in animals submitted to models predictive of antidepressant-, anxiolytic- and anticompulsive-like effects. Swiss mice receiving PPADS at 12.5mg/kg showed reduced immobility time in the forced swimming test (FST) similarly to the prototype antidepressant imipramine (30mg/kg). This dose was also able to decrease the number of buried marbles in the marble-burying test (MBT), an anticompulsive-like effect. However, no effect was observed in animals submitted to the elevated plus maze (EPM) and to the open field test. The systemic administration of iso-PPADS, a preferential P2XR antagonist, also reduced the immobility time in FST, which was associated to a decrease in NOx levels in the prefrontal cortex. In addition, P2X7 receptor was found co-immunoprecipitated with neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) in the prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that P2X7, possibly coupled to NOS1, could modulate behavioral responses associated to stress-related disorders and it could be a new target for the development of more effective treatments for affective disorders.

vitamin B,Impact of exercise and vitamin B1 intake on hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor and spatial memory performance in a rat model of stress - PubMed,"              Chronic stress affects brain areas involved in learning and emotional responses through modulation of neurotropic factors or neurotransmitters. Therefore, we investigated the role of exercise and thiamine supplementation on spatial memory and on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and acetylcholine (Ach) content in the hippocampus of the stressed animals. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups (8 rats/group): control group; stress group; swimming and stress group; and thiamine and stress group. All animals were assessed by a T maze for spatial memory or open field test for locomotion and anxiety. BDNF and Ach were estimated in the hippocampus. Chronic immobilization stress resulted in a significant decrease in BDNF and Ach levels in the hippocampus and impairment in spatial memory functions and decreased basal activity. However, either swimming training or thiamine intake for 30 d was proved to induce a significant increase both in BDNF and Ach in conjunction with improved performance in the T maze, marked anxiolytic effect and enhanced ambulation in the open field test, as compared to the stress group. Interestingly, swimming-exercised rats showed significantly higher levels of BDNF versus thiamine-receiving rats, while thiamine-receiving rats showed higher locomotor activity and less freezing behavior in the open field test compared to the swimming group. It was concluded that decreased BDNF and Ach after stress exposure could be a mechanism for the deleterious actions of stress on memory function; swimming exercise or vitamin B1 supplementation for 30 d was a protective tool to improve coping with chronic stress by modulating BDNF and Ach content along with enhancement of memory functions and motor activities.

vitamin B,The anxiolytic effect of chronic inositol depends on the baseline level of anxiety - PubMed,"              Inositol, a precursor for membrane phosphoinositides involved in signal transduction, has been found to be clinically effective in a number of psychiatric disorders and to reverse behavioural effects of lithium. To gain insight into the mechanism of action of inositol, it is critical to establish its efficacy in animal models. Following the initial report by Cohen et al. (1997b) that inositol was anxiolytic in the elevated plus maze model of anxiety, the effect of chronic intraperitoneal and chronic dietary inositol administration in rats was tested in four experiments. There was a significant increase in closed arm and total arm entries following chronic injection of inositol, but no effect of inositol when it was given chronically in rat chow. Because the first 2 experiments suggested that the mode of drug administration affected the control levels of anxiety (open arm entries and time in open arms) in control groups, the effect of chronic dietary inositol was tested in rats that were exposed to a mild and a more severe form of stress. Chronic saline injections elevated anxiety in the plus maze, which was only marginally affected by chronic dietary inositol. Following 3 weeks administration of 5% dietary inositol rats were pre-exposed to a cat. There was a clear increase in number of entries into open arms, suggesting an anxiolytic effect of inositol.          "
vitamin B,Direct projection from the lateral habenula to the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus in rats - PubMed,"              Trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus (Vmes) neurons are primary afferents conveying deep sensation from the masticatory muscle spindles or the periodontal mechanoreceptors, and are crucial for controlling jaw movements. Their cell bodies exist in the brain and receive descending commands from a variety of cortical and subcortical structures involved in limbic (emotional) systems. However, it remains unclear how the lateral habenula (LHb), a center of negative emotions (e.g., pain, stress and anxiety), can influence the control of jaw movements. To address this issue, we examined whether and how the LHb directly projects to the Vmes by means of neuronal tract tracing techniques in rats. After injections of a retrograde tracer Fluorogold in the rostral and caudal Vmes, a number of neurons were labeled in the lateral division of LHb (LHbl) bilaterally, whereas a few neurons were labeled in the medial division of LHb (LHbm) bilaterally. After injections of an anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextranamine (BDA) in the LHbl, a small number of labeled axons were distributed bilaterally in the rostral and caudal levels of Vmes, where some labeled axonal boutons contacted the cell body of rostral and caudal levels of Vmes neurons bilaterally. After the BDA injection into the LHbm, however, no axons were labeled bilaterally in the rostral and caudal levels of Vmes. Therefore, the present study for the first time demonstrated the direct projection from the LHbl to the Vmes and the detailed projection patterns, suggesting that jaw movements are modulated by negative emotions that are signaled by LHbl neurons.

vitamin B,Salivary cortisol and anxiety in recurrent aphthous stomatitis - PubMed,"              Anxiety and salivary cortisol were measured in two groups of patients with recurrent aphthous ulceration. One group of patients had persistent aphthae (Group 1) and the others had been relieved of their aphthae following correction of detected haematinic deficiency states (Group 2). Anxiety was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale and radioimmunoassay of salivary cortisol. There was a statistically significant increased proportion of borderline or clinically anxious patients in Group 1 compared to Group 2 (P < 0.05). Median salivary cortisol levels also showed a statistically significant elevation in Group 1 (P < 0.01). It is concluded that stress may play a role in the aetiology of recurrent aphthous stomatitis, particularly in patients who have an underlying anxiety trait.          "
vitamin B,"Erythrocyte fatty acid profiles and plasma homocysteine, folate and vitamin B6 and B12 in recurrent depression: Implications for co-morbidity with cardiovascular disease - PubMed","              Oxidative stress induced interactions between fatty acid (FA) and one-carbon metabolism may be involved in co-occurrence of major depressive disorder (MDD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which have been scarcely studied together. In 137 recurrent MDD-patients vs. 73 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, we simultaneously measured key components of one-carbon metabolism in plasma (homocysteine, folate, vitamins B6 and B12), and of FA-metabolism in red blood cell membranes [main polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (AA) and structural FA-indices (chain length, unsaturation, peroxidation)]. Results show significant positive associations of folate with EPA, DHA, and the peroxidation index, which were similar in patients and controls. After correction for confounders, these associations were lost except for EPA. Associations between B-vitamins and FA-parameters were non-significant, but also similar in patients and controls. Homocysteine and DHA were significantly less negatively associated in patients than in controls. In conclusion, these data indicate similarities but also differences in associations between parameters of one-carbon and FA-metabolism in recurrent MDD patients vs. controls, which may reflect differences in handling of oxidative stress. Further research should test the consequences of these differences, particularly the premature development of CVD in MDD.           "
vitamin B,Premenstrual tension syndrome - PubMed,"              The premenstrual syndrome is discussed in relation to prevalence, symptomatology, severity, and time course. Methodologic problems common to the study of the menstrual cycle are presented. The research on psychologic and physiologic etiologies is reviewed, and results of studies on various treatment modes are discussed. Newer theories suggesting a combined psychophysiologic etiology and concomitant nonpharmaceutical treatment modes encompassing self-care and stress management skills are included.          "
vitamin B,Acetyl-L-carnitine as a putative candidate for the treatment of stress-related psychiatric disorders: Novel evidence from a zebrafish model - PubMed,"              Stress-related psychiatric disorders are mental conditions that affect mood, cognition and behavior and arise because of the impact of prolonged stress on the central nervous system (CNS). Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) is an acetyl ester of L-carnitine that easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and was recently found to be decreased in patients with major depressive disorder. ALC plays a role in energy metabolism and is widely consumed as a nutritional supplement to improve physical performance. In this study, our objective was to evaluate the effects of ALC treatment (0.1 mg/L, 10 min) for 7 days on behavior and oxidative stress in zebrafish subjected to unpredictable chronic stress (UCS) protocol. Behavioral outcomes were assessed in the novel tank test, and parameters of oxidative status (lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defenses) were evaluated in the brain using colorimetric methods. According to our previous findings, UCS increased anxiety-like behavior and lipid peroxidation, while it decreased non-protein thiol levels and superoxide dismutase activity. However, ALC reversed the anxiety-like behavior and oxidative damage in stressed animals, while it was devoid of effect in control animals. Although our data reinforce the neuroprotective potential of ALC in the treatment of psychiatric disorders related to stress, further investigations are required to clarify its mechanisms of action and confirm its efficacy.

vitamin B,Effects of Alpha-Lipoic Acid Supplementation on Inflammatory Biomarkers and Matrix Metalloproteinase-3 in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients - PubMed,"        Objective:                    Although many studies have considered alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) as a potent antioxidant with anti-inflammatory functions in oxidative stress-associated inflammatory diseases, few studies have evaluated its efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Therefore, we aimed to examine the effects of ALA on serum biomarkers of joint damage and inflammation in women with RA.                  Methods:                    We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which RA patients (n = 70) aged 20-50 years were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either ALA (1200 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks. Fasting blood samples were taken before and after the study to analyze inflammatory biomarkers including serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and serum matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) as a marker of joint erosion. Moreover, 3-day dietary records, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), and the Spielberger State-Trait anxiety inventory form Y (STAI-Y) were assessed before and after the intervention.                  Results:                    Sixty-five RA patients completed the trial. No statistically significant differences were observed in serum levels of hs-CRP, TNF-α, IL-6, and MMP-3 within and between the ALA and placebo groups (p > 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in dietary intakes, physical activity, and anxiety levels between groups at baseline and they remained statistically unchanged during the study period (p > 0.05).                  Conclusion:                    Although in theory ALA supplementation could serve as a beneficial nutraceutical in RA patients, in the present study serum inflammatory biomarkers and MMP-3 were not significantly affected by 8 weeks of ALA supplementation.

vitamin B,[Pharmacotherapy of the hyperventilation syndrome] - PubMed,"              Hyperventilation may be induced by several organic factors. The HVS-hyperventilation and symptoms such as hypertonia and pain-hypocapnia and disturbance of the acid-base balance--other symptoms--anxiousness--hyperventilation--etc. In the adaptation-hyperventilation and symptoms such as hypertonia and pain,-hupocapnia and disturbance of the acid-base balance-other symptoms--anxiousness--hyperventilation--etc. In the adaptation process one distinguishes the load, the strain and a tension or counterforce (stress). In the cause and effect relationship between the adaptation process and a specific pathology, it is obvious that the strain is the only element capable of eliciting the specific pathology or syndrome. Stress is a compensation for the strain and is therefore beneficial to the organism. The strain is associated with, amongst other things, anxiety and changes in the pyridoxine-L-tryptophan metabolism (nicotinic acid-ribonucleotide synthesis). Stress depends to a large extent on the intact serotonergic transmission in the cerebrum. But serotonin synthesis is critically dependent on the pyridoxine-L-tryptophan metabolism. Benzodiazepines improve the hyperventilation, anxiousness and strain, if these are of the free-floating anxiety type. Tricyclic preparations improve anxiousness in as much as it assumes the character of fear, phobia or an anxiety attack. They are active against strain when that reveals itself as an anxiety attack. Pyridoxine and L-tryptophan as serotonergic agonists, improve the hyperventilation, have a beneficial effect on symptoms such as hypertonia and pain, are effective against anxiousness and anxiety and potentiate the stress. In addition they directly correct the property of strain, i.e. the disturbance of the nicotinicacid-ribonucleotide synthesis. Clomipramine is the most potent serotonergic agonist available. That substance has a favourable effect on hyperventilation, hypertonia and pain, on anxiousness that expresses itself as fear, phobia or an anxiety attack. It favours stress. Further investigation is desirable, in particular of the new serotonergic agonists that have recently been made available or are still to come.          "
vitamin B,Thiamine and benfotiamine prevent stress-induced suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis in mice exposed to predation without affecting brain thiamine diphosphate levels - PubMed,"              Thiamine is essential for normal brain function and its deficiency causes metabolic impairment, specific lesions, oxidative damage and reduced adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Thiamine precursors with increased bioavailability, especially benfotiamine, exert neuroprotective effects not only for thiamine deficiency (TD), but also in mouse models of neurodegeneration. As it is known that AHN is impaired by stress in rodents, we exposed C57BL6/J mice to predator stress for 5 consecutive nights and studied the proliferation (number of Ki67-positive cells) and survival (number of BrdU-positive cells) of newborn immature neurons in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. In stressed mice, the number of Ki67- and BrdU-positive cells was reduced compared to non-stressed animals. This reduction was prevented when the mice were treated (200mg/kg/day in drinking water for 20days) with thiamine or benfotiamine, that were recently found to prevent stress-induced behavioral changes and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) upregulation in the CNS. Moreover, we show that thiamine and benfotiamine counteract stress-induced bodyweight loss and suppress stress-induced anxiety-like behavior. Both treatments induced a modest increase in the brain content of free thiamine while the level of thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) remained unchanged, suggesting that the beneficial effects observed are not linked to the role of this coenzyme in energy metabolism. Predator stress increased hippocampal protein carbonylation, an indicator of oxidative stress. This effect was antagonized by both thiamine and benfotiamine. Moreover, using cultured mouse neuroblastoma cells, we show that in particular benfotiamine protects against paraquat-induced oxidative stress. We therefore hypothesize that thiamine compounds may act by boosting anti-oxidant cellular defenses, by a mechanism that still remains to be unveiled. Our study demonstrates, for the first time, that thiamine and benfotiamine prevent stress-induced inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis and accompanying physiological changes. The present data suggest that thiamine precursors with high bioavailability might be useful as a complementary therapy in several neuropsychiatric disorders.          "
vitamin B,A randomised trial of nutrient supplements to minimise psychological stress after a natural disaster - PubMed,"              After devastating flooding in southern Alberta in June 2013, we attempted to replicate a New Zealand randomised trial that showed that micronutrient (minerals, vitamins) consumption after the earthquakes of 2010-11 resulted in improved mental health. Residents of southern Alberta were invited to participate in a study on the potential benefit of nutrient supplements following a natural disaster. Fifty-six adults aged 23-66 were randomised to receive a single nutrient (vitamin D, n=17), a few-nutrients formula (B-Complex, n=21), or a broad-spectrum mineral/vitamin formula (BSMV, n=18). Self-reported changes in depression, anxiety and stress were monitored for six weeks. Although all groups showed substantial decreases on all measures, those consuming the B-Complex and the BSMV formulas showed significantly greater improvement in stress and anxiety compared with those consuming the single nutrient, with large effect sizes (Cohen's d range 0.76-1.08). There were no group differences between those consuming the B-Complex and BSMV. The use of nutrient formulas with multiple minerals and/or vitamins to minimise stress associated with natural disasters is now supported by three studies. Further research should be carried out to evaluate the potential population benefit that might accrue if such formulas were distributed as a post-disaster public health measure.           "
vitamin B,"Lipoic acid and pentoxifylline mitigate nandrolone decanoate-induced neurobehavioral perturbations in rats via re-balance of brain neurotransmitters, up-regulation of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, and down-regulation of TNFR1 expression - PubMed","              Behavioral perturbations associated with nandrolone decanoate abuse by athletes and adolescents may be attributed to oxidative stress and inflammation. However, the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully explored. On the other hand, the natural antioxidant lipoic acid can pass the blood brain barrier and enhance Nrf2/HO-1 (nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1) pathway. In addition, the phosphodiesterase-IV inhibitor xanthine derivative pentoxifylline has a remarkable inhibitory effect on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Therefore, this study aimed at investigation of the possible protective effects of lipoic acid and/or pentoxifylline against nandrolone-induced neurobehavioral alterations in rats. Accordingly, male albino rats were randomly distributed into seven groups and treated with either vehicle, nandrolone (15mg/kg, every third day, s.c.), lipoic acid (100mg/kg/day, p.o.), pentoxifylline (200mg/kg/day, i.p.), or nandrolone with lipoic acid and/or pentoxifylline. Rats were challenged in the open field, rewarded T-maze, Morris water maze, and resident-intruder aggression behavioral tests. The present findings showed that nandrolone induced hyperlocomotion, anxiety, memory impairment, and aggression in rats. These behavioral abnormalities were accompanied by several biochemical changes, including altered levels of brain monoamines, GABA, and acetylcholine, enhanced levels of malondialdehyde and TNF-α, elevated activity of acetylcholinesterase, and up-regulated expression of TNF-α receptor-1 (TNFR1). In addition, inhibited catalase activity, down-regulated Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, and suppressed acetylcholine receptor expression were observed. Lipoic acid and pentoxifylline combination significantly mitigated all the previously mentioned deleterious effects mainly via up-regulation of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, inhibition of TNF-α and down-regulation of TNFR1 expression. In conclusion, the biochemical and histopathological findings of this study revealed the protective mechanisms of lipoic acid and pentoxifylline against nandrolone-induced behavioral changes and neurotoxicity in rats.

vitamin B,Antagonic-stress. A new treatment in gerontopsychiatry and for a healthy productive life - PubMed,"              A complex antiaging formula--Antagonic-Stress--was investigated vs. placebo (PL), meclofenoxate (MF)--neurometabolic nootropic and vs. nicergoline (NE)--cerebral vasodilator by comparative multiple trials (double-blind, randomized, and parallel) in gerontopsychiatry (DSM-III-R, 1987 and ICD-10, 1992 criteria). AS vs. PL studies in organic mental disorders--amnestic, depressive, anxiety, associated with axis III physical disorders or conditions, and in multiinfarct dementia were followed by AS vs. MF or NE investigations in senile dementia of Alzheimer's type. A total of 343 old people, distributed in 4 PL groups, 1 MF group, 1 NE group, and 5 AS groups were studied. Multiple investigations, before and after three-month treatments were made: psychometric evaluation by Sandoz Clinical Assessment-Geriatric, Self-Assessment Scale-Geriatric and their 5 subscales; psychopathological rating by Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Scales; as well as psychometric testing by digit symbol of WAIS, Wechsler Memory Scale and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). Except PL, prolonged and large dose treatments with these cerebral activators (MF, NE and especially AS) reduced the psychogeriatric-psychopathological scores and the deterioration index, and improved cognitive performance. The therapeutical effectiveness of AS multiple formula in gerontopsychiatry and its superiority vs. monotherapy (MF or NE) are discussed in connection with its complex neurometabolic and synergetic composition, multiple antioxidative combinations, free radical scavengers, lipofuscinolytic agents, the antiischemic action of antioxidants, multivitamin and multimineral supplementation, and with the better efficacy of multitherapy vs. monotherapy in geriatrics.

vitamin B,Biological markers in psychiatry - PubMed,"              Biological markers in psychiatry are defined as measurable and quantifiable indices of psychiatric disorders. Criteria for biological markers are discussed. The criteria for the assignment of a biological marker to the pathophysiology, pathogenesis, or etiology of a disorder are proposed. None of the biological markers described in the literature for depression, schizophrenia, alcoholism or anxiety as separate disorder fulfills the specified criteria. Most of them can at best be considered as biological markers of the aspecific processes of strain and stress. Free-floating anxiety is the clinical hallmark of strain.          "
vitamin B,The effect of Shexiang Tongxin Dropping Pills on coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMVD) among those with a mental disorder and non-obstructive coronary artery disease based on stress cardiac magnetic resonance images: A study protocol - PubMed,"        Introduction:                    Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMVD), highly prevalent among patients with a mental disorder (anxiety or depression), is closely related to adverse cardiac events, including hospitalization, sudden cardiac death, and myocardial infarction. Shexiang Tongxin Dropping Pills (STDP), a traditional Chinese medicine, exerts endothelial protective function by anti-inflammation, anti-oxidative stress, and promoting blood circulation. STDP protects against CMVD in previous fundamental studies. The present trial is aiming at evaluating the effect of STDP on CMVD among depressed or anxious patients with non-obstructive coronary artery disease (NOCAD).                  Methods and analysis:                    Seventy-two depressed or anxious patients diagnosed with NOCAD combined with CMVD utilizing coronary artery angiography and stress cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) will be recruited in the present study. These patients will be randomized into two groups, namely, Nicorandil group (Nicorandil combined with routine medicine), and STDP groups (STDP combined with routine medicine). The change of CMVD status by assessing absolute myocardial blood flow and myocardial reperfusion using stress CMR 3-month after discharge is defined as the primary endpoint. Major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), quality of life (QOL), and metal disorder improvement are defined as the secondary endpoints. Seattle angina questionnaire (SAQ) which is used to assess angina pectoris and QOL will be recorded at 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-month of follow-up. Seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and 9-item depression module from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) which utilized to evaluate anxiety and depression, respectively, will be recorded at 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-month of follow-up. This study will first evaluate the efficacy of STDP on CMVD among patients with a mental disorder and NOCAD, and discuss the potential mechanisms, providing therapeutic evidence for the STDP for these patients.

vitamin B,A RCT of psychotherapy in women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy - PubMed,"        Study question:                    Does adding psychological intervention to medical therapy improve nausea/vomiting, psychological symptoms, and pregnancy distress in women with moderate nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP)?                  Summary answer:                    Three weeks of medical therapy plus psychotherapy yielded statistically and clinically significant improvements in NVP-specific symptoms, anxiety/depression symptoms, and pregnancy distress, compared with medical therapy alone.                  What is known already:                    Pregnancy with nausea/vomiting is associated with psychiatric morbidity. Evidence supports the exploration of psychosocial reactions in addition to biochemical markers related to NVP.                  Study design, size, duration:                    This prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group study was performed at two obstetrics clinics in Iran. A total of 86 women, aged 18-40 years, between 6 and 12 weeks pregnant with moderate NVP, more than 5 years of education, and not currently practicing any relaxation techniques or undergoing any psychotherapy, were enrolled from June 2013 to November 2014.                  Participants/materials, setting, methods:                    A total of 86 moderate NVP women were randomly allocated to either a control (medical therapy alone) or experimental (medical therapy plus psychotherapy) group. Block randomization was achieved using a paper list prepared by an investigator with no clinical involvement in the trial. The experimental group was given pyridoxine hydrochloride (40 mg daily) for 3 weeks, and also received intensive mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) in eight individual sessions (50 min each) over 3 weeks. The control group was given pyridoxine hydrochloride (40 mg daily tablet) for 3 weeks alone. All participants completed the Rhodes index of nausea, vomiting and retching (RINVR), the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), and the prenatal distress questionnaire (PDQ) at baseline, 3 weeks after baseline at the end of the study, and at a 1 month post-treatment follow-up. Linear mixed-effects models were used, in an intention-to-treat analysis.                  Main results and role of chance:                    In the psychotherapy plus medical therapy group, the mean relative difference between baseline and post-treatment decreased for RINVR; nausea 8.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.1, 10.2), vomiting 3.5 (95% CI 1.5, 5.8), and total RINVR 11.7 (95% CI 6.5, 16.5), for HADS; anxiety 5.1 (95% CI 3.2, 9.2), depression 3.5 (95% CI 2.4, 7.3), total HADS 7.2 (95% CI 4.4, 12.1), for PDQ; birth concerns 3.3 (95% CI 1.3, 9.1), body concerns 1.5 (95% CI 0.9, 5.1), relationship concerns 2.1 (95% CI 1.2, 5.9), and total PDQ 5.9 (95% CI 3.5, 10.6). At 1 month after treatment, the statistically significant improvement in RINVR, HADS and PDQ, as well as clinical improvement in severity of symptoms, persisted. Medical therapy plus psychotherapy also improved nausea/vomiting symptoms, psychological symptoms, and reduced pregnancy distress more than medical therapy alone, with an effect size of 0.42-0.72 over the trial period.                  Limitations, reasons for caution:                    The conclusions were limited to a small number of women with moderate NVP. It is unclear whether the difference between the outcomes in the different groups was related to MBCT alone, or to the extra time and attention paid to patients in the medical therapy plus psychotherapy. The participants in the study did not remain blind to the treatment and the outcome may only be representative of women with moderate NVP who have been referred to obstetrics clinics.                  Wider implications of the findings:                    These findings show that adding 3 weeks of psychological intervention to medical therapy may appear to produce positive therapeutic outcomes upon conclusion of treatment, and 1 month after treatment. This suggests that psychotherapy should be considered as an adjunctive treatment option for women with moderate NVP. In future studies, however, a group of patients who are receiving placebo psychotherapy along with medical treatment should be included. Furthermore, an economic evaluation of the addition of psychological intervention to standard medical therapy would be useful.          "
vitamin B,"A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of B Vitamin Supplementation on Depressive Symptoms, Anxiety, and Stress: Effects on Healthy and 'At-Risk' Individuals - PubMed","              A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to examine and quantify the effects of B vitamin supplementation on mood in both healthy and 'at-risk' populations. A systematic search identified all available randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of daily supplementation with ≥3 B group vitamins with an intervention period of at least four weeks. Random effects models for a standardized mean difference were used to test for overall effect. Heterogeneity was tested using the I2 statistic. Eighteen articles (16 trials, 2015 participants) were included, of which 12 were eligible for meta-analysis. Eleven of the 18 articles reported a positive effect for B vitamins over a placebo for overall mood or a facet of mood. Of the eight studies in 'at-risk' cohorts, five found a significant benefit to mood. Regarding individual facets of mood, B vitamin supplementation benefited stress (n = 958, SMD = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.02, 0.45, p = 0.03). A benefit to depressive symptoms did not reach significance (n = 568, SMD = 0.15, 95% CI = -0.01, 0.32, p = 0.07), and there was no effect on anxiety (n = 562, SMD = 0.03, 95% CI = -0.13, 0.20, p = 0.71). The review provides evidence for the benefit of B vitamin supplementation in healthy and at-risk populations for stress, but not for depressive symptoms or anxiety. B vitamin supplementation may particularly benefit populations who are at risk due to (1) poor nutrient status or (2) poor mood status.          "
vitamin B,Serum folate and fetal growth retardation: a matter of compliance? - PubMed,"              Serum folate levels were measured at 30 weeks' gestational age in 289 pregnant women, each of whom had been provided with folate supplementation at enrollment in prenatal care. There was a significant association between low serum folate levels and fetal growth retardation. High folate levels were most likely explained by recent folic acid intake. Therefore, we were concerned that the decreased fetal growth associated with low folate levels may have been related to a combination of psychological and behavioral characteristics for which low serum folate levels were only a surrogate measure. A profile of maternal psychosocial status was created, which included measures of depression, anxiety, self-esteem, mastery, stress, and social support. Poorer psychological scores were significantly related to lower serum folate levels. However, in women with both good and poor psychosocial scores, high folate levels were significantly associated with increased birth weight, a relationship that persisted even after adjusting for maternal race, body mass index, smoking, history of a low birth weight infant, and infant gender. Our findings suggest that women with good psychosocial scores are more likely to take folate, but that the use of folate itself is related to a lower risk of fetal growth retardation and increased birth weight.

vitamin B,P2X7 purinergic receptors participate in the expression and extinction processes of contextual fear conditioning memory in mice - PubMed,"              The purinergic system consists of two large receptor families - P2X and P2Y. Both are activated by adenosine triphosphate (ATP), although presenting different functions. These receptors are present in several brain regions, including those involved in emotion and stress-related behaviors. Hence, they seem to participate in fear- and anxiety-related responses. However, few studies have investigated the purinergic system in threatening situations, as observed in contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Therefore, this study investigated the involvement of purinergic receptors in the expression and extinction of aversive memories. C57Bl/6 background mice were submitted to the CFC protocol. Wildtype (WT) mice received i.p. injection of either a nonselective P2 receptor (P2R) antagonist, P178 (10 or 30 mg/kg); a selective P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) antagonist, A438079 (10 mg/kg); a selective P2Y1 receptor (P2Y1R) antagonist, MRS2179 (10 mg/kg); or vehicle 10 min prior to or immediately after the extinction session. Additionally, P2X7R KO mice were tested in the CFC protocol. After P2R antagonist treatment, contextual fear recall increased, while acquisition of extinction was impaired. Similar results were observed with the selective P2X7R antagonist, but not with the selective P2Y1R antagonist. Interestingly, P2X7R KO mice showed increased contextual fear recall, associated with impaired acquisition of extinction, in accordance with pharmacologic P2X7R antagonism. Our results suggest that specific pharmacological or genetic blockade of P2X7R promotes anxiogenic-like effects, along with deficits in extinction learning. Thus, these receptors could present an alternative treatment of stress-related psychiatric disorders.          "
vitamin B,Stress-induced structural plasticity of medial amygdala stellate neurons and rapid prevention by a candidate antidepressant - PubMed,"              The adult brain is capable of adapting to internal and external stressors by undergoing structural plasticity, and failure to be resilient and preserve normal structure and function is likely to contribute to depression and anxiety disorders. Although the hippocampus has provided the gateway for understanding stress effects on the brain, less is known about the amygdala, a key brain area involved in the neural circuitry of fear and anxiety. Here, in mice more vulnerable to stressors, we demonstrate structural plasticity within the medial and basolateral regions of the amygdala in response to prolonged 21-day chronic restraint stress (CRS). Three days before the end of CRS, treatment with the putative, rapidly acting antidepressant, acetyl-l-carnitine (LAC) in the drinking water opposed the direction of these changes. Behaviorally, the LAC treatment during the last part of CRS enhanced resilience, opposing the effects of CRS, as shown by an increased social interaction and reduced passive behavior in a forced swim test. Furthermore, CRS mice treated with LAC show resilience of the CRS-induced structural remodeling of medial amygdala (MeA) stellate neurons. Within the basolateral amygdala (BLA), LAC did not reduce, but slightly enhanced, the CRS-increased length and number of intersections of pyramidal neurons. No structural changes were observed in MeA bipolar neurons, BLA stellate neurons or in lateral amygdala stellate neurons. Our findings identify MeA stellate neurons as an important component in the responses to stress and LAC action and show that LAC can promote structural plasticity of the MeA. This may be useful as a model for increasing resilience to stressors in at-risk populations.          "
vitamin B,A randomized controlled trial comparing lifestyle intervention to letrozole for ovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a study protocol - PubMed,"        Background:                    Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects between 8 and 18% of women and is the leading cause of female anovulatory infertility. Unfortunately, common treatments for women trying to conceive can be ineffective as well as disruptive or harmful to patients' quality of life. Despite evidence that women with PCOS have expressed the need for alternative fertility treatments, lifestyle interventions incorporating a nutritional plan with supplementation, increased physical activity, and techniques for stress management have not been combined as a program and studied in this population. Literature suggests that each of these individual components can positively influence reproductive hormones and metabolic health.                  Methods/design:                    This is a randomized controlled trial which will include 240 women diagnosed with PCOS, according to the Rotterdam criteria, who are trying to conceive. Participants will be randomized to either a comprehensive lifestyle intervention program or prescribed an oral fertility medication, letrozole. These two groups will be further randomized to consume either myo-inositol or a placebo. Participants will be between the ages of 18 and 37 years. Exclusion criteria include women who have already begun fertility treatment, who are currently using myo-inositol or have taken it within the past 3 months, or who are being treated for, or have a history of, an eating disorder. The primary outcome will be the ovulation rate, the secondary outcome will be conception. Other outcomes include miscarriage rates, validated rating measures of overall quality of life (including social, relational, mind/body and emotional sub-categories) and mental health scores (depression, anxiety, and stress).                  Discussion:                    This trial will determine the effectiveness of a structured lifestyle-based comprehensive intervention program for women with PCOS experiencing infertility. In addition, it will determine whether supplementing with myo-inositol provides any further benefit. The objective of this study is to assess a possible non-pharmacological solution to ovulatory dysfunction in these patients and perhaps improve other associated features of PCOS.

vitamin B,"Exploring relationships among psychosocial status, dietary quality, and measures of placental development during the first trimester in low-income women - PubMed","        Purpose:                    To examine the relationships between maternal psychosocial factors and dietary quality and explore the relationships among dietary quality and selected biomarkers of nutrition and placental development.                  Method:                    A cross-sectional design in 18 low-income, pregnant women.                  Results:                    Partner support was positively related to vegetable intake (r = .54) and negatively related to intake of iron (r = -.68) and grains (r = -.67). Emotional eating in response to anger was negatively related to intake of iron-(r /it> = -.53) and folate-rich (r = -.75) foods, and emotional eating in response to anxiety was negatively related to intake of folate-rich foods (r = -.51). Depressed women had an increased intake of calcium-rich foods (r = .60). Levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were negatively related to depression (r = -.56) and intake of foods high in calcium (r = -.53) and iron (r = -.34) but positively related to serum calcium levels (r = .60). VEGF was negatively relationship to soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1; r = -.56). Placental growth factor had a negative relationship with maternal serum levels of albumin (r = -.61) and calcium (r = -.65).                  Conclusions:                    Low-income pregnant women who eat to cope with anger and anxiety may have an inadequate intake of nutrients that contribute to positive pregnancy outcomes. Placental development in the early weeks of pregnancy may be influenced by maternal psychosocial and nutritional status. More research is needed to explore the relationship of dietary quality and placental development in the first trimester of pregnancy.          "
vitamin B,"Efficacy of Cognition Support Formula® on cognitive function in older adults with subjective cognitive impairment: a protocol for a 26-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial - PubMed","        Background:                    Due to an ageing population in Australia there has been an increase in the number of older adults with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), a self-reported decline in cognitive function associated with an increased risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. There is no current, recommended treatment for SCI; therefore, the effectiveness of a supplement approved by the Therapeutic Goods Association that has the potential to enhance cognitive function in an at-risk cohort should be tested. The primary aim of this proposed research is to determine the efficacy of 6 months of treatment with BioCeuticals Cognition Support Formula® (containing Bacopa monniera (brahmi), Ginkgo biloba, Panax ginseng and alpha-lipoic acid) on cognition in older adults with SCI (utilising the CogState® one card learning and identification tests as co-primary outcome measures of visual short-term memory and attention; mean speed (ms), accuracy (%), and total number of hits, misses, and anticipations) compared with placebo. The secondary aims are to assess an improvement in other cognitive domains (executive functioning, processing speed, and working memory), evaluate safety, adverse effects, and determine efficacy on mood, fatigue, and neurocognition. It is expected that improvements across the study timepoints in the co-primary outcomes in the active treatment group (compared with placebo) will be evident.                  Method:                    One-hundred and twenty participants will be recruited for the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups (active or placebo) at a 1:1 ratio, and will be required to complete a series of cognitive (using CogState®), mood (using the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-42) and Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI)), and fatigue (using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F)) tasks at baseline (0 months), the midpoint (3 months), and the endpoint (6 months). These tasks will be evaluated between timepoints (baseline vs. midpoint, midpoint vs. endpoint, and baseline vs. endpoint). Neurocognition will be measured by electroencephalography at baseline and at the endpoint in half of the participants. Adverse effects will be documented over the 6-month trial period.                  Discussion:                    This is the first study to test the efficacy of Cognition Support Formula® on cognition in older adults with SCI. As people with SCI have an increased risk of dementia, and there are limited treatments options for this population, it is important to assess a supplement that has the potential to enhance cognitive function.

vitamin B,High-dose pyridoxine as an 'anti-stress' strategy - PubMed,"              Pyridoxine nutritional status has a significant and selective modulatory impact on central production of both serotonin and GABA - neurotransmitters which control depression, pain perception, and anxiety - owing to the fact that the decarboxylases which produce these neurotransmitters have a relatively low affinity for pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). Pyridoxine deficiency leads to increased sympathetic outflow and hypertension in rodents, possibly reflecting decreased central production of these neurotransmitters; conversely, supplemental pyridoxine lowers blood pressure in many animal models of hypertension, and there is preliminary evidence for antihypertensive activity in humans as well. Additionally, physiological levels of PLP interact with glucocorticoid receptors to down-regulate their activity. Thus, high-dose pyridoxine, by amplifying tissue levels of PLP, may be expected to have a favorable impact on certain dysphoric mental states, while diminishing sympathetic output and acting peripherally to blunt the physiological impact of corticosteroids. In light of growing evidence that chronic dysphoria, particularly when accompanied by hopelessness or cynicism, has a major negative impact on morbidity and mortality from a wide range of disorders, high intakes of pyridoxine may have the potential to improve prognosis in many individuals. With respect to cardiovascular health, reduction of homocysteine levels should contribute to this benefit. These predictions are consistent with recent epidemiology correlating plasma PLP levels with risk for vascular events and overall survival.          "
vitamin B,Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in obsessive-compulsive disorder before and after treatment with inositol - PubMed,"              Inositol, a glucose isomer and second messenger precursor, regulates numerous cellular functions and has demonstrated efficacy in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) through mechanisms that remain unclear. The effect of inositol treatment on brain function in OCD has not been studied to date. Fourteen OCD subjects underwent single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with Tc-99m HMPAO before and after 12 weeks of treatment with inositol. Whole brain voxel-wise SPM was used to assess differences in perfusion between responders and nonresponders before and after treatment as well as the effect of treatment for the group as a whole. There was 1) deactivation in OCD responders relative to nonresponders following treatment with inositol in the left superior temporal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus and precuneus, and the right paramedian post-central gyrus; 2) no significant regions of deactivation for the group as a whole posttreatment; and 3) a single cluster of higher perfusion in the left medial prefrontal region in responders compared to nonresponders at baseline. Significant reductions in the YBOCS and CGI-severity scores followed treatment. These data are only partly consistent with previous functional imaging work on OCD. They may support the idea that inositol effects a clinical response through alternate neuronal circuitry to the SSRIs and may complement animal work proposing an overlapping but distinct mechanism of action.

vitamin B,A meta-analysis of inositol for depression and anxiety disorders - PubMed,"        Objective:                    This study is a meta-analysis of inositol as a treatment for depression and anxiety disorders.                  Methods:                    PubMed, Cochrane Library database, and PsycINFO were searched up to 14 August 2013. A systematic review and meta-analysis of double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted comparing inositol for depressed or anxiety disorder patients.                  Results:                    Seven RCTs in depression (two bipolar depression studies, one bipolar depression and major depressive disorder (MDD) study, two MDD studies, and two premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) studies) (n = 242) were identified. Four RCTs in anxiety disorders (two obsessive-compulsive disorder studies, one panic disorder study, and one posttraumatic stress disorder study) (n = 70) were also identified. There were no statistically significant effects of inositol on depressive, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms and discontinuation (all-cause, side effects, and worsening psychiatric symptoms). However, inositol had marginally more responders in depression than placebo (p = 0.06), and inositol showed a trend towards superior efficacy for depressive symptoms in patients with PMDD (p = 0.07). Inositol marginally caused gastrointestinal upset compared with placebo (p = 0.06).                  Conclusions:                    Our results suggest that inositol may be beneficial for depressed patients, especially those with PMDD. The main limitation of this report is that a small number of studies were included in this meta-analysis.          "
vitamin B,Augmentation therapy with alpha-lipoic acid and desvenlafaxine: a future target for treatment of depression? - PubMed,"              This study was designed to investigate the possible antidepressant effects of the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) as a stand-alone treatment or in association with desvenlafaxine (DVS) in the chronic corticosterone (CORT)-induced depression model. The depression model was induced by repeated administrations of CORT (20 mg/kg, subcutaneous) in mice over a period of 14 days. Between days 15 and 21, a randomized group of mice received DVS (10 or 20 mg/kg, per os [PO]), ALA (100 or 200 mg/kg, PO), or a combination of DVS (10 or 20 mg/kg, PO) and ALA (100 or 200 mg/kg, PO) along with the CORT injections for the remaining 7 days. Other groups of mice received DVS (10 or 20 mg/kg, PO) or ALA (100 or 200 mg/kg, PO) alone. Open field test, elevated plus maze (EPM) test, tail suspension test (TST), and forced swimming test (FST) were carried out 1 h after the last injection of CORT. Repeated CORT injections induced anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors as observed by decreased open arms entries in the EPM test and increased immobility time in the TST and FST. The administration of DVS and ALA alone was able to reverse the increases in the immobility time. The combination of ALA and DVS potentiated the observed effects of DVS. These results suggest that augmentation therapy with the addition of antioxidant drugs may be an important pharmacological approach for the treatment of depression.           "
bacopa monnieri,Insights Into the Molecular Aspects of Neuroprotective Bacoside A and Bacopaside I - PubMed,"              Bacopa monnieri, commonly known as Brahmi, has been extensively used as a neuromedicine for various disorders such as anxiety, depression and memory loss. Chemical characterization studies revealed the major active constituents of the herb as the triterpenoid saponins, bacosides. Bacoside A, the vital neuroprotective constituent, is composed of four constituents viz., bacoside A3, bacopaside II, jujubogenin isomer of bacopasaponin C (bacopaside X) and bacopasaponin C. B. monnieri extracts as well as bacosides successfully establish a healthy antioxidant environment in various tissues especially in the liver and brain. Free radical scavenging, suppression of lipid peroxidation and activation of antioxidant enzymes by bacosides help to attain a physiological state of minimized oxidative stress. The molecular basis of neuroprotective activity of bacosides is attributed to the regulation of mRNA translation and surface expression of neuroreceptors such as AMPAR, NMDAR and GABAR in the various parts of the brain. Bioavailability as well as binding of neuroprotective agents (such as bacosides) to these receptors is controlled by the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB). However, nano conversion of these drug candidates easily resolves the BBB restriction and carries a promising role in future therapies. This review summarizes the neuroprotective functions of B. monnieri extracts as well as its active compounds (bacoside A, bacopaside I) and the molecular mechanisms responsible for these pharmacological activities.

bacopa monnieri,"Plant-based medicines for anxiety disorders, part 2: a review of clinical studies with supporting preclinical evidence - PubMed","              Research in the area of herbal psychopharmacology has revealed a variety of promising medicines that may provide benefit in the treatment of general anxiety and specific anxiety disorders. However, a comprehensive review of plant-based anxiolytics has been absent to date. Thus, our aim was to provide a comprehensive narrative review of plant-based medicines that have clinical and/or preclinical evidence of anxiolytic activity. We present the article in two parts. In part one, we reviewed herbal medicines for which only preclinical investigations for anxiolytic activity have been performed. In this current article (part two), we review herbal medicines for which there have been both preclinical and clinical investigations of anxiolytic activity. A search of MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, Scopus and the Cochrane Library databases was conducted (up to 28 October 2012) for English language papers using the search terms 'anxiety' OR 'anxiety disorder' OR 'generalized anxiety disorder' OR 'social phobia' OR 'post-traumatic stress disorder' OR 'panic disorder' OR 'agoraphobia' OR 'obsessive compulsive disorder' in combination with the search terms 'Herb*' OR 'Medicinal Plants' OR 'Botanical Medicine' OR 'Chinese herb*', in addition to individual herbal medicines. This search of the literature revealed 1,525 papers, of which 53 plants were included in the review (having at least one study using the whole plant extract). Of these plants, 21 had human clinical trial evidence (reviewed here in part two), with the other 32 having solely preclinical evidence (reviewed in part one). Support for efficacy was found for chronic use (i.e. greater than one day) of the following herbs in treating a range of anxiety disorders in human clinical trials: Piper methysticum, Matricaria recutita, Ginkgo biloba, Scutellaria lateriflora, Silybum marianum, Passiflora incarnata, Withania somniferum, Galphimia glauca, Centella asiatica, Rhodiola rosea, Echinacea spp., Melissa officinalis and Echium amoenum. For several of the plants studied, conclusions need to be tempered due to methodological issues such as small sample sizes, brief intervention durations and non-replication. Current evidence does not support Hypericum perforatum or Valeriana spp. for any anxiety disorder. Acute anxiolytic activity was found for Centella asiatica, Salvia spp., Melissa officinalis, Passiflora incarnata and Citrus aurantium. Bacopa monnieri has shown anxiolytic effects in people with cognitive decline. The therapeutic application of psychotropic plant-based treatments for anxiety disorders is also discussed, specifically Psychotria viridis and Banisteriopsis caarti (ayahuasca), Psilocybe spp. and cannabidiol-enriched (low tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC)) Cannabis spp.          "
bacopa monnieri,Neuroprotective effects of Bacopa monnieri in experimental model of dementia - PubMed,"              Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by dementia that begins as mild short term memory deficit and culminates in total loss of cognitive and executive functions. The present study was conducted to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of Bacopa monnieri (BM), an Indian traditional medicinal plant effective against cognitive impairment, in colchicine-induced dementia. Intracerebroventricular administration of colchicine (15 μg/5 μl) induced cognitive impairment in rats as assessed by elevated plus maze. This was accompanied by a significant increase in oxidative stress in term of enhanced levels of lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyls. Concomitantly, decrease in activity of antioxidant enzymes was observed in colchicine treated animals. BM (50 mg/kg body weight) supplementation reversed memory impairment observed in the colchicine treated rats. BM administration attenuated oxidative damage, as evident by decreased LPO and protein carbonyl levels and restoration in activities of the antioxidant enzymes. The activity of membrane bound enzymes (Na(+)K(+) ATPase and AChE) was altered in colchicine treated brain regions and BM supplementation was able to restore the activity of enzymes to comparable values observed in controls. The results suggest therapeutic potential of BM in the treatment of AD associated cognitive decline.          "
bacopa monnieri,"Alteration in 5-HT₂C, NMDA receptor and IP3 in cerebral cortex of epileptic rats: restorative role of Bacopa monnieri - PubMed","              Bacopa monnieri is effective in stress management, brain function and a balanced mood. 5-HT2C receptors have been implicated in stress whereas NMDA receptors and mGlu5 play crucial role in memory and cognition. In the present study, we investigated the role of B. monnieri extract in ameliorating pilocarpine induced temporal lobe epilepsy through regulation of 5-HT2C and NMDA receptors in cerebral cortex. Our studies confirmed an increased 5-HT2C receptor function during epilepsy thereby facilitating IP3 release. We also observed an decreased NMDA receptor function with an elevated mGlu5 and GLAST gene expression in epileptic condition indicating the possibility for glutamate mediated excitotoxicity. These alterations lead to impaired behavioural functions as indicated by the Elevated Plus maze test. Carbamazepine and B. monnieri treatments to epileptic rats reversed the alterations in 5-HT2C, NMDA receptor functions and IP3 content thereby effectively managing the neurotransmitter balance in the cerebral cortex.

bacopa monnieri,"An acute, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study of 320 mg and 640 mg doses of Bacopa monnieri (CDRI 08) on multitasking stress reactivity and mood - PubMed","              Little research exists in humans concerning the anxiolytic, antidepressant, sedative, and adaptogenic actions the traditional Ayurvedic medicine Bacopa monnieri (BM) possesses in addition to its documented cognitive-enhancing effects. Preclinical work has identified a number of acute anxiolytic, nootropic, and adaptogenic effects of BM that may also co-occur in humans. The current double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study assessed the acute effects of a specific extract of BM (KeenMind® - CDRI 08) in normal healthy participants during completion of a multitasking framework (MTF). Seventeen healthy volunteers completed the MTF, at baseline, then 1 h and 2 h after consuming a placebo, 320 mg BM and 640 mg of BM. Treatments were separated by a 7-day washout with order determined by Latin Square. Outcome measures included cognitive outcomes from the MTF, with mood and salivary cortisol measured before and after each completion of the MTF. Change from baseline scores indicated positive cognitive effects, notably at both 1 h post and 2 h post BM consumption on the Letter Search and Stroop tasks, suggesting an earlier nootropic effect of BM than previously investigated. There were also some positive mood effects and reduction in cortisol levels, pointing to a physiological mechanism for stress reduction associated with BM consumption. It was concluded that acute BM supplementation produced some adaptogenic and nootropic effects that need to be replicated in a larger sample and in isolation from stressful cognitive tests in order to quantify the magnitude of these effects. The study was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12612000834853).          "
bacopa monnieri,Bacopa monnieri modulates endogenous cytoplasmic and mitochondrial oxidative markers in prepubertal mice brain - PubMed,"              Bacopa monnieri (BM) an herb, found throughout the Indian subcontinent in wet, damp and marshy areas is used in Ayurvedic system of medicine for improving intellect/memory, treatment of anxiety and neuropharmacological disorders. Although extensively given to children as a memory enhancer, no data exists on its ability to modulate neuronal oxidative stress in prepubertal animal models. Hence in this study, we examined if dietary intake of BM leaf powder has the propensity to modulate endogenous markers of oxidative stress, redox status (reduced GSH, thiol status), response of antioxidant defenses (enzymic), protein oxidation and cholinergic function in various brain regions of prepubertal (PP) mice. PP mice maintained on a BM-enriched diet (0.5 and 1%) for 4 weeks showed a significant diminution of basal oxidative markers (malondialdehyde levels, reactive species generation, hydroperoxide levels and protein carbonyls) in both cytoplasm and mitochondria of all brain regions. This was accompanied with enhanced reduced glutathione, thiol levels and elevated activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase). Significant reduction in the activity of acetyl cholinesterase enzyme in all brain regions suggested the potential of BM leaf powder to modulate cholinergic function. Further evidence that dietary intake of BM leaf powder confers the prepubertal brain with additional capacity to cope up with neurotoxic prooxidants was obtained by exposing cortical/cerebellar synaptosomes of normal and BM fed mice to 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA). While synaptosomes from control mice exhibited a concentration related lipid peroxidation and ROS generation, synaptosomes obtained from BM fed mice showed only a marginal induction at the highest concentration clearly suggesting their increased resistance to 3-NPA-induced oxidative stress. Collectively these data clearly indicate the potential of Bacopa monnieri to modulate endogenous markers of oxidative stress in brain tissue of PP mice. Based on these results, it is hypothesized that dietary intake of BM leaf powder confers neuroprotective advantage and is likely to be effective as a prophylactic/therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative disorders involving oxidative stress.

bacopa monnieri,Bacopa monnieri Supplements Offset Paraquat-Induced Behavioral Phenotype and Brain Oxidative Pathways in Mice - PubMed,"        Background:                    Parkinson's Disease (PD) is characterized by alterations in cerebellum and basal ganglia functioning with corresponding motor deficits and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Involvement of oxidative dysfunction has been implicated for the progression of PD, and environmental neurotoxin exposure could influence such behavior and psychiatric pathology. Assessing dietary supplementation strategies with naturally occurring phytochemicals to reduce behavioral anomalies associated with neurotoxin exposure would have major clinical importance. The present investigation assessed the influence of Bacopa monneri (BM) on behaviors considered to reflect anxiety-like state and motor function as well as selected biochemical changes in brain regions of mice chronically exposed to ecologically relevant herbicide, paraquat (PQ).                  Materials & methods:                    Male mice (4-week old, Swiss) were daily provided with oral supplements of standardized BM extract (200 mg/kg body weight/day; 3 weeks) and PQ (10 mg/kg, i.p. three times a week; 3 weeks).                  Results:                    We found that BM supplementation significantly reversed the PQ-induced reduction of exploratory behavior, gait abnormalities (stride length and mismatch of paw placement) and motor impairment (rotarod performance). In a separate study, BM administration prevented the reduction in dopamine levels and reversed cholinergic activity in brain regions important for motor (striatum) pathology. Further, in mitochondria, PQ-induced decrease in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity and energy charge (MTT reduction), was restored with BM supplementation.                  Conclusion:                    These findings suggest that BM supplementation mitigates paraquat-induced behavioral deficits and brain oxidative stress in mice. However, further investigations would enable us to identify specific molecular mechanism by which BM influences behavioural pathology.          "
green tea,The Japanese Tea Ceremony and stress management - PubMed,"              When people attend a Japanese Tea Ceremony, they often remark that it had a calming effect on them. The Tea Ceremony can be much more than that, however. Serious practitioners of tea develop a mind set and body control that enables them to transform tension-producing details of everyday life into moments of beauty, meaningfulness and tranquility. This effect comes from ritualizing ordinary chores and giving them an esthetic dimension and a noble motivation. Such discipline of mind and body also enables tea people to concentrate solely on the present moment, thereby shutting out worries about the past and anxieties about the future.          "
green tea,Parenting program versus telephone support for Mexican parents of children with acquired brain injury: A blind randomized controlled trial - PubMed,"        Introduction:                    Acquired brain injury (ABI) during childhood typically causes behavior problems in the child and high levels of stress in the family. The aims of this study are: (1) to investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of a parenting intervention in improving behavior and self-regulation in Mexican children with ABI compared to telephone support; (2) to investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of a parenting intervention in improving parenting skills, parent self-efficacy and decreasing parental stress in parents of children with ABI compared to telephone support. Our secondary aims are (1) to explore the impact that parent characteristics have on the intervention outcomes; (2) to investigate if changes are maintained 3 months after the intervention.                  Methods:                    The research design is a blind randomized controlled trial (RCT). Eligible participants include children with a diagnosis of ABI, between 6 and 12 years of age, and their parents. Sixty-six children and their parents will be randomly allocated to either a parenting program group or telephone support group. The parenting program involves six face-to-face weekly group sessions of 2.5 h each. Participants in the control group receive an information sheet with behavioral strategies, and six weekly phone calls, in which strategies to improve academic skills are provided. Children and their parents are evaluated by blind assessors before the intervention, immediately after the intervention and 3-months post-intervention.                  Discussion:                    This study will be the first to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of a parenting program for Mexican parents of children with ABI.

green tea,Anxiolytic properties of green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) - PubMed,"              Naturally occurring polyphenols are potent antioxidants. Some of these compounds are also ligands for the GABA(A) receptor benzodiazepine site. This feature endows them with sedative properties. Here, the anxiolytic activity of the green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was investigated after acute administration in mice, using behavioral tests (elevated plus-maze and passive avoidance tests) and by electrophysiology on cultured hippocampal neurons. Patch-clamp experiments revealed that EGCG (1-10 muM) had no effect on GABA currents. However, EGCG reversed GABA(A) receptor negative modulator methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) inhibition on GABA currents in a concentration dependent manner. This was also observed at the level of synaptic GABA(A) receptors by recording spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission. In addition, EGCG consistently inhibited spontaneous excitatory synaptic transmission. Behavioral tests indicated that EGCG exerted both anxiolytic and amnesic effects just like the benzodiazepine drug, chlordiazepoxide. Indeed, EGCG in a dose-dependent manner both increased the time spent in open arms of the plus-maze and decreased the step-down latency in the passive avoidance test. GABA(A) negative modulator beta-CCM antagonized EGCG-induced amnesia. Finally, state-dependent learning was observable after chlordiazepoxide and EGCG administration using a modified passive avoidance procedure. Optimal retention was observed only when animals were trained and tested in the same state (veh-veh or drug-drug) and significant retrieval alteration was observed in different states (veh-drug or drug-veh). Moreover, EGCG and chlordiazepoxide fully generalized in substitution studies, indicating that they induced indistinguishable chemical states for the brain. Therefore, our data support that EGCG can induce anxiolytic activity which could result from an interaction with GABA(A) receptors.          "
green tea,Effects of L-theanine or caffeine intake on changes in blood pressure under physical and psychological stresses - PubMed,"        Background:                    L-theanine, an amino acid contained in green tea leaves, is known to block the binding of L-glutamic acid to glutamate receptors in the brain, and has been considered to cause anti-stress effects by inhibiting cortical neuron excitation. Both L-theanine and caffeine, which green tea contains, have been highlighted for their beneficial effects on cognition and mood.                  Methods:                    In this study, we investigated the effects of orally administered L-theanine or caffeine on mental task performance and physiological activities under conditions of physical or psychological stress in humans. Fourteen participants each underwent three separate trials, in which they orally took either L-theanine + placebo, caffeine + placebo, or placebo only.                  Results:                    The results after the mental tasks showed that L-theanine significantly inhibited the blood-pressure increases in a high-response group, which consisted of participants whose blood pressure increased more than average by a performance of a mental task after placebo intake. Caffeine tended to have a similar but smaller inhibition of the blood-pressure increases caused by the mental tasks. The result of the Profile of Mood States after the mental tasks also showed that L-theanine reduced the Tension-Anxiety scores as compared with placebo intake.                  Conclusions:                    The findings above denote that L-theanine not only reduces anxiety but also attenuates the blood-pressure increase in high-stress-response adults.          "
green tea,Influence of continued ingestion of matcha on emotional behaviors after social stress in mice - PubMed,"              Matcha has high contents of theanine, caffeine, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Among these, theanine reduces psychological and physiological stress responses, although this effect is disturbed by caffeine and EGCG. It was reported that the continued ingestion of high-quality matcha, whose molar ratio of caffeine and EGCG to theanine and arginine was kept at less than two, reduces stress responses. However, most matcha on the market has an inadequate ratio. Therefore, we investigated the influence of continued ingestion of matcha with a ratio of over two, on emotional behaviors after stress. Continued ingestion of matcha was suggested to reduce the anxiety-like behaviors induced by psychological and physiological stresses.          "
green tea,Aromatherapy and Essential Oils: A Map of the Evidence - PubMed,"        Background:                    The purpose of this review is to provide the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) with a broad overview of the effectiveness of aromatherapy and essential oils (EOs), and the health conditions for which these interventions have been examined.                  Data Sources and Study Selection:                    We searched multiple databases through February 2019 for systematic reviews (SRs) of aromatherapy and EOs for health conditions. Using pre-specified inclusion criteria, all abstracts and full-text articles were dual-screened for inclusion. When there were several qualified reviews for the same health condition, we selected a single review based on its recency, methods, scope, and applicability.                  Data Abstraction:                    From each review, we abstracted the focus of the SR, the number of controlled trials included, combined number of participants, duration of trials, condition treated, and relevant findings from controlled trials. We abstracted separate data for each of 5 outcome categories: psychological outcomes, nausea/vomiting, pain and other physical outcomes, sleep outcomes, and global health outcomes.                  Data Synthesis:                    For each review and outcome category we assigned values representing the effectiveness level of the intervention and confidence in the evidence and used these values to generate evidence maps. Additionally, we provide a narrative synthesis of the findings.                  Results:                    We included 26 SRs representing the most recent and comprehensive evidence available. There is moderate-confidence evidence that aromatherapy is beneficial for pain in dysmenorrhea. Aromatherapy is potentially effective for pain in labor/childbirth; blood pressure reduction in hypertension; stress, depression, and sleep in hemodialysis patients; stress in healthy adults; anxiety in perioperative patients; and sleep quality in various populations, with low to moderate confidence in the evidence. For EOs applied topically, there is moderate confidence in the potentially positive effect of tea tree oil for tinea pedis. There is insufficient evidence of efficacy for all other conditions examined.          "
green tea,"Expectancies, not aroma, explain impact of lavender aromatherapy on psychophysiological indices of relaxation in young healthy women - PubMed","        Objectives:                    In aromatherapy, lavender aroma is reputed to assist with relaxation. However, while there is much anecdotal evidence to that effect, the empirical literature is very inconsistent. Failure to employ adequate placebos, proper blinding, objective measures, or screening of prior beliefs about aromatherapy means that many previous findings could have been influenced by expectancy biases. The present study sought to establish whether lavender aroma and/or expectancies affect post-stress relaxation.                  Design:                    A double-blind, 3 (aroma) x 3 (instruction) x 10 (time in minutes) mixed-factorial placebo-controlled trial.                  Method:                    In a laboratory, 96 healthy undergraduate women were exposed to lavender, placebo, or no aroma during physiologically assessed relaxation after an arousing cognitive task. Where an aroma was presented, an instructional priming procedure was used to manipulate participants' expectancies about the aroma's likely impact on their ability to relax.                  Results:                    Results showed no effect of aroma on galvanic skin response during relaxation. However, the nature of instructional prime was associated with relaxation patterns: when expecting the aroma to inhibit them, participants relaxed more; when expecting facilitation, participants relaxed less. The effect was not seen with regard to self-reported relaxation (as represented by changes in state anxiety) and was independent of ratings of attitudes towards aromatherapy.                  Conclusions:                    The findings imply that the previous associations of lavender aroma with assisted relaxation may have been influenced by expectancy biases, and that the relevant expectancies are easily manipulable.

green tea,[Ethnographic study of neurological and mental diseases among the Uru-Chipaya peoples of the Andean Altiplano] - PubMed,"        Introduction:                    The Uru-Chipaya people are an ethnic group of about 2,500 people, descendants of primitive Andean cultures. Their isolation (they live at an altitude of 4,000 metres in southern Bolivia), their non-written language (Chipaya-Puquina) and their traditional way of life, clothing and customs, which are similar to those used for thousands of years, make this an unusual culture. The aim of our work was to carry out an ethnographic study of the neurological diseases experienced by these people, the way they conceive such disorders and their therapeutic approaches to them.                  Development:                    An ethnographic field study was conducted in June 2004. A structured interview was held with a yatiri, or Chipaya healer, to allow classification of the neurological or mental diseases. Epilepsy (tukuri) is interpreted as being a consequence of an evil spirit entering through the nose. Treatment consists in drinking an infusion containing dried powdered butterfly (jesko), birds or curupancho. Achamixi (headache) is common and is treated by drinking the yatiri's fermented urine, herb tea made from the chachacoma plant and by blowing, which is done by the yatiri over the patient's head. Fright, the symptoms of which are similar to those of a post-traumatic stress disorder, is treated by a wilancha, that is, the ritual sacrifice of a llama offered to the Pachamama. Sadness, the cultural equivalent to depression, is treated with infusions made from ayrampo, a plant found in the Andean Altiplano. Psychosis (sumsu), which is treated by means of a wilancha, and mental retardation/static encephalopathy (pustkis), which are considered to be a result of a fright suffered by the mother during pregnancy, also exist. No mention was made of the existence of extrapyramidal or vascular pathologies.                  Conclusion:                    The cultural equivalents of certain neurological pathologies (headache, epilepsy, mental retardation, anxiety and depression) are present in this ancestral culture.

green tea,"Effect of epigallocatechin gallate supplementation in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder: an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study - PubMed","        Objectives:                    Strategies that focus on the reduction of oxidative stress and inflammation may have therapeutic benefit for the treatment of schizophrenia. This clinical trial sought to determine, in a double-blind study, whether epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a green tea extract, is a useful adjunct to maintenance antipsychotic medication.                  Methods:                    Adults with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder who were maintained on antipsychotic and other psychotropic medications were randomized to supplemental EGCG or placebo. Study participants completed clinical assessments and blood draws to evaluate supplemental treatment effects on psychiatric symptoms and plasma inflammatory markers.                  Results:                    A total of 34 participants (17 EGCG, 17 placebo) were randomized and 25 participants (14 EGCG, 11 placebo) completed the study. Both treatment groups showed significant reductions in psychotic, depressive and anxiety symptoms from baseline to end of treatment. However, EGCG did not significantly affect psychiatric symptoms or inflammatory markers, as compared with placebo. Adverse effects were mild and comparable between groups.                  Conclusion:                    There was no signal for a therapeutic effect of the green tea extract EGCG on psychiatric symptoms in this placebo-controlled pilot study.          "
green tea,An optimal dose of tea polyphenols protects against global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury - PubMed,"              Previous studies addressing the protection of tea polyphenols against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury often use focal cerebral ischemia models, and the optimal dose is not unified. In this experiment, a cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury rat model was established using a modified four-vessel occlusion method. Rats were treated with different doses of tea polyphenols (25, 50, 100, 150, 200 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection. Results showed that after 2, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours of reperfusion, peroxide dismutase activity and total antioxidant capacity in brain tissue gradually increased, while malondialdehyde content gradually decreased after tea polyphenol intervention. Tea polyphenols at 200 mg/kg resulted in the most apparent changes. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling and flow cytometry showed that 200 mg/kg tea polyphenols significantly reduced the number and percentage of apoptotic cells in the hippocampal CA1 region of rats after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. The open field test and elevated plus maze experiments showed that tea polyphenols at 200 mg/kg strengthened exploratory behavior and reduced anxiety of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injured rats. Experimental findings indicate that tea polyphenols protected rats against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and 200 mg/kg is regarded as the optimal dose.           "

In Traditional Tibetan Medicine anxiety and depression are commonly treated with an herbal compound known as Agar-35.                  Objective:                    The objective of this pilot study was to explore whether Agar-35 tea would improve anxiety, affect, stress, and rumination.                  Methods:                    Undergraduate psychology students (N=14) were randomized to drink either Agar-35 tea (n=6) or placebo tea (n=8) for 7 nights.                  Results:                    The results indicated that Agar-35 significantly reduced participants' negative affect compared to placebo, U = 6.0, p = .019, effect size, r = .63. Further, Agar-35 also reduced anxiety (trending toward significance), U = 10.0, p = .071, effect size, r = .48.                  Conclusion:                    In accordance with its use in Tibetan Medicine, these preliminary findings suggest that Agar-35 may benefit aspects of psychological health.          "
green tea,Coadministration of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and caffeine in low dose ameliorates obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in obese rats - PubMed,"              Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and caffeine in tea exert anti-obesity effects and induces nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) amelioration. However, previous studies usually performed a high-dose EGCG administration, whereas the insecurity was arisen in recent researches. In this study, we treated obese rats with an elaborate dose-40 mg/kg EGCG, 20 mg/kg caffeine, and the coadministration of them as low dose, which were similar to the daily intake; 160 mg/kg EGCG as high dose, which was the maximum safe dose had touched the contentious edge. The results suggested that the coadministration of EGCG and caffeine exerted more remarkable function on suppressing body weight gain, reducing white adipose tissue weight and decreasing the energy intake than single use. This may be due to the variation in serum lipid profile, oxidative stress, and adipose-derived and inflammatory cytokines. The pathological micrographs showed long-term high-fat diets caused severe NAFLD, but it was ameliorated at different levels by all of the administrations. In summary, low dose of EGCG or caffeine only showed a mild effect of anti-obesity and NAFLD amelioration. The coadministration of them could exert a superior curative effect as well as high dose EGCG but no anxiety regarding safety.          "
green tea,"Intermittent drinking, oxytocin and human health - PubMed","              Looking at a waterhole, it is surprising that so many animals share the same space without visible signs of anxiety or aggression. Although waterholes are the preferred feeding locations of large carnivores, waterholes are shared by all type of herbivores of all sizes and shapes, including elephants. Recent research shows that the homeostatic disturbances leading to the ""thirst feeling"" not only activate specific substances regulating water and mineral household, but also the ""trust and love"" hormone oxytocin, while decreasing the production of the typical stress hormone cortisol. People using drugs, seem to be in search for oxytocin, as evidenced in studies with individuals on drugs such as ecstasy and gamma-hydroxybyturate. Hot environment, drought and increased sweating also activate specific oxytocin-producing parts of the hypothalamus, just as breastfeeding does in mother and infant. Water homeostasis is the only allostatic system activating trust neuro-anatomy and we suggest that this is due to the fact that all animals depend on water, whereas food type is species specific. Our hypothesis; regulating drinking behaviour through intermittent bulk drinking could increase oxytocin signalling, recover human trust and increase health by down-regulation of stress axis activity and inflammatory activity of the immune system. Intermittent bulk drinking should be defined as water (including tea and coffee) drinking up to a feeling of satiety and regulated by a mild feeling of thirst. This would mean that people would not drink less quantity but less frequently and that's how all animals, but also human newborns behave. It is the latter group, which is probably the only group of humans with a normal fluid homeostasis.           "
green tea,"Antinociceptive, neurobehavioral and antioxidant effects of Eupatorium triplinerve Vahl on rats - PubMed","        Ethnopharmacological relevance:                    Eupatorium triplinerve Vahl belongs to the Asteraceae family, popularly known as Japana. It is a perennial shrub native to Amazon rainforests of South America. Its leaves are used through infusions, decoctions, baths, and tea. It is largely used in Brazilian folk medicine as sedative, febrifuge, stimulant, tonic and anti-inflammatory.                  Aim of the study:                    The present study evaluated the putative effects of Eupatorium triplinerve on the central nervous system (CNS), including locomotor and anxiety activity, depression-like behavior, and antinociception and oxidative stress.                  Materials and methods:                    Two-month-old male Wistar rats (n=7-10 rats/group) and Swiss male and female mice of the species Mus musculus (n=7-10 per group) were administered with 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg, 600 mg/kg, and 800 mg/kg of hydroalcoholic extracts of Eupatorium triplinerve (HEET). The behavioral assays included open-field (OF), elevated Plus-maze (EPM), and forced swimming tests (FS). The antinociceptive activity was verified using chemical (acetic acid and formalin) and thermal (hot plate) models of nociception. The oxidative stress levels were measured in rat blood samples after behavioral assays and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), nitric oxide and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured in vivo.                  Results:                    Oral pretreatment with HEET reduced the locomotion in OF test (200-800 mg/kg), increased central locomotion and open arms entries in the OF and EPM tests, respectively (600-800 mg/kg), and decreased the immobility time in the FS (200-800 mg/kg). It also reduced the writhing number evoked by acetic acid injection (200-800 mg/kg) and licking time in the first phase of the formalin test (400-800 mg/kg). In the oxidative stress assays, the extract decreased TEAC, Nitric Oxide and MDA levels in response to swimming stress induced in rats.                  Conclusions:                    These results were indicative for the first time that Eupatorium triplinerve exerted mild sedative, anxiolytic and antidepressive effects on the CNS. Antinociceptive effects not related to opioid system and antioxidant activity were also observed. These results support the ethnopharmacological use of Eupatorium triplinerve in popular medicine.          "
green tea,Antidepressant Effect of Shaded White Leaf Tea Containing High Levels of Caffeine and Amino Acids - PubMed,"              The young leaves of green tea become lighter in color than usual when protected from sunlight by a shading net for about two weeks while growing. These leaves are called ""shaded white leaf tea"" or SWLT. In the eluate of SWLT, the amount of amino acids (361 mg/L) was significantly higher than that in regular tea (53.5 mg/L). Since theanine and arginine, the first and second most abundant amino acids in SWLT, have significant antistress effects, we examined the antistress effect of SWLT on humans. SWLT or placebo green tea (3 g) was eluted with room-temperature water (500 mL). Participants consumed the tea for one week prior to pharmacy practice and continued for 10 days in the practice period. The state-trait anxiety inventory, an anxiety questionnaire, tended to be scored lower in the SWLT group than the placebo, but other stress markers showed no differences. The effect of the difference in SWLT components examined with mice showed that aspartic acid and asparagine, which are abundant in SWLT, counteracted the antistress effects of theanine and arginine. Large amounts of caffeine also interfered with SWLT's antistress effect. Thus, SWLT, which is high in caffeine and amino acids, suppressed depressant behavior in mice.          "
green tea,"Caffeine consumption and self-assessed stress, anxiety, and depression in secondary school children - PubMed","              Previous research suggests that effects of caffeine on behaviour are positive unless one is investigating sensitive groups or ingestion of large amounts. Children are a potentially sensitive subgroup, and especially so considering the high levels of caffeine currently found in energy drinks. The present study used data from the Cornish Academies Project to investigate associations between caffeine (both its total consumption, and that derived separately from energy drinks, cola, tea, and coffee) and single-item measures of stress, anxiety, and depression, in a large cohort of secondary school children from the South West of England. After adjusting for additional dietary, demographic, and lifestyle covariates, positive associations between total weekly caffeine intake and anxiety and depression remained significant, and the effects differed between males and females. Initially, effects were also observed in relation to caffeine consumed specifically from coffee. However, coffee was found to be the major contributor to high overall caffeine intake, providing explanation as to why effects relating to this source were also apparent. Findings from the current study increase our knowledge regarding associations between caffeine intake and stress, anxiety, and depression in secondary school children, though the cross-sectional nature of the research made it impossible to infer causality.

green tea,"Anti-stress effect of theanine on students during pharmacy practice: positive correlation among salivary α-amylase activity, trait anxiety and subjective stress - PubMed","        Purpose:                    Theanine, an amino acid in tea, has significant anti-stress effect on experimental animals under psychosocial stress. Anti-stress effect of theanine on humans was evaluated in 5th-year university students during pharmacy practice.                  Method:                    The study design was a single-blind group comparison and participants (n=20) were randomly assigned to theanine or placebo groups. Theanine or placebo (lactose) tablets (200 mg, twice a day, after breakfast and lunch) were taken from 1 week prior to the pharmacy practice and continued for 10 days in the practice period. To assess the anxiety of the participants, the state-trait anxiety inventory test was carried out before the pharmacy practice. Salivary α-amylase activity (sAA) was measured as a marker of sympathetic nervous system activity.                  Results:                    In the placebo-group, sAA in the morning (pre-practice sAA) was higher than in theanine-group during the pharmacy practice (p=0.032). Subjective stress was significantly lower in the theanine-group than in the placebo-group (p=0.020). These results suggest that theanine intake had anti-stress effect on students. Furthermore, students with higher pre-practice sAA showed significantly higher trait anxiety in both groups (p=0.015). Similarly, higher pre-practice sAA was correlated to shorter sleeping time in both groups (p=0.41×10(-3)).                  Conclusion:                    Stressful condition increased the level of sAA that was essentially affected by individual trait anxiety. The low levels of pre-practice sAA and subjective stress in the theanine-group suggest that theanine intake suppressed initial stress response of students assigned for a long-term commitment of pharmacy practice.

green tea,GABA-enriched teas as neuro-nutraceuticals - PubMed,"              Teas enriched in GABA are consumed for their beneficial effects on blood pressure, stress and anxiety. These effects may involve actions of GABA on the central and peripheral nervous systems. The anaerobic procedures for the production of GABA-enriched teas increase GABA levels by 10-20 times. They also significantly alter the levels of other constituents that may interact with the actions of GABA. These include epigallocatechin gallate, caffeine and theanine. The possible interactions of these active constituents make the understanding of the effects of GABA-enriched teas complex. More data is needed to establish where and how GABA is acting following consumption of GABA-enriched teas. While there is considerable evidence that such GABA is acting on GABA receptors in the periphery, there is rather less evidence that is acting directly in the brain. Certainly, there is more to the action of GABA-enriched teas than GABA itself.          "
green tea,Effects of L-theanine on posttraumatic stress disorder induced changes in rat brain gene expression - PubMed,"              Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by the occurrence of a traumatic event that is beyond the normal range of human experience. The future of PTSD treatment may specifically target the molecular mechanisms of PTSD. In the US, approximately 20% of adults report taking herbal products to treat medical illnesses. L-theanine is the amino acid in green tea primarily responsible for relaxation effects. No studies have evaluated the potential therapeutic properties of herbal medications on gene expression in PTSD. We evaluated gene expression in PTSD-induced changes in the amygdala and hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were assigned to PTSD-stressed and nonstressed groups that received either saline, midazolam, L-theanine, or L-theanine + midazolam. Amygdala and hippocampus tissue samples were analyzed for changes in gene expression. One-way ANOVA was used to detect significant difference between groups in the amygdala and hippocampus. Of 88 genes examined, 17 had a large effect size greater than 0.138. Of these, 3 genes in the hippocampus and 5 genes in the amygdala were considered significant (P < 0.05) between the groups. RT-PCR analysis revealed significant changes between groups in several genes implicated in a variety of disorders ranging from PTSD, anxiety, mood disorders, and substance dependence.           "
green tea,Pu-Erh tea and GABA attenuates oxidative stress in kainic acid-induced status epilepticus - PubMed,"        Background:                    Pu-Erh tea is one of the most-consumed beverages due to its taste and the anti-anxiety-producing effect of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) if contains. However the protective effects of Pu-Erh tea and its constituent, GABA to kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure have not been fully investigated.                  Methods:                    We analyzed the effect of Pu-Erh tea leaf (PETL) and GABA on KA-induced neuronal injury in vivo and in vitro.                  Results:                    PETL and GABA reduced the maximal seizure classes, predominant behavioral seizure patterns, and lipid peroxidation in male FVB mice with status epilepticus. PETL extracts and GABA were effective in protecting KA-treated PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner and they decreased Ca(2+) release, ROS production and lipid peroxidation from KA-stressed PC12 cells. Western blot results revealed that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), RhoA and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression were increased in PC12 cells under KA stress, and PETL and GABA significantly reduced COX-2 and p38 MAPK expression, but not that of RhoA. Furthermore, PETL and GABA reduced PGE(2) production from KA-induced PC12 cells.                  Conclusions:                    Taken together, PETL and GABA have neuroprotective effects against excitotoxins that may have clinical applications in epilepsy.          "

Methods:                    This is a cross-sectional study and included 886 women. Data were collected with a questionnaire including questions about demographics and independent variables tested, the Menopause Symptom Checklist and The MOS 36-Item Short Form Health Survey.                  Results:                    The mean age of the women included in the study was 48.62 years (standard deviation (S.D.)=5.75, range: 40-60 years). Of all women, 32.1% were premenopausal, 23.9% perimenopausal and 44.2% postmenopausal. Stepwise multiple regression analyses, performed to determine factors associated with menopausal symptom score, revealed 12 statistically significant variables which increased the strength of the model. These variables were as follows in the order of their contribution to the strength of the model: health problems, recent life stresses, being a primary school graduate, absence of relaxation methods, number of pregnancy, financial problems, tea consumption, inadequate and unbalanced nutrition, coffee consumption, age, being a secondary school graduate and dissatisfaction in marriage. Besides, there was a significant and moderately negative relation between total menopausal symptom scores and quality of life scores.                  Conclusions:                    A large number of factors were associated with experiencing menopausal symptoms and menopausal symptoms had negative effects on the quality of life among Turkish women. Stress management and health promoting practices should be incorporated into menopausal care programs to improve health and quality of life of middle-aged women.          "
green tea,l-theanine attenuates abstinence signs in morphine-dependent rhesus monkeys and elicits anxiolytic-like activity in mice - PubMed,"              l-theanine, 2-amino-4-(ethylcarbamoyl) butyric acid, an amino acid found in green tea (Camellia sinensis), is sold in the United States as a dietary supplement to reduce stress and improve cognition and mood. The observations that l-theanine has been shown to inhibit caffeine's stimulatory effects and that caffeine produces precipitated withdrawal signs in opioid-addicted monkeys and some opioid withdrawal signs in some normal monkeys, suggest that l-theanine may suppress opioid withdrawal signs. Additionally, l-theanine produces anxiolytic effects in humans indicating that it has anti-anxiety properties. Thus, in these studies we determined whether l-theanine attenuates opioid-withdrawal signs in morphine-dependent rhesus monkeys, a model for spontaneous opioid withdrawal in human opioid addicts. We also evaluated whether l-theanine decreases anxiety-like behavior in mice, using the elevated plus maze and marble burying assays. l-theanine significantly attenuated designated opioid withdrawal signs, including fighting, rigid abdominal muscles, vocalizing on palpation of abdomen, pacing, retching, wet-dog shakes, and masturbation. It had a relatively quick onset of action that persisted for at least 2.5h. l-theanine also produced anxiolytic-like effects in the elevated plus maze and the marble burying assay in naïve mice at doses that did not significantly affect motor behavior. The results of these studies suggest that l-theanine may be useful in the pharmacotherapy of treating opioid withdrawal as well as anxiety-associated behaviors.          "
green tea,Black tea aroma inhibited increase of salivary chromogranin-A after arithmetic tasks - PubMed,"        Background:                    Growing attention has been paid to the effects of food flavor components on alleviating negative brain functions caused by stressful lifestyles. In this study, we investigated the alleviating effect of two kinds of black tea aromas on physical and psychological stress induced by the Uchida-Kraepelin test, based on salivary chromogranin-A (CgA) levels as a stress marker and subjective evaluations (Profile of Mood States).                  Results:                    Compared with the water exposure control, inhaling black tea aroma (Darjeeling and Assam in this study) induced lower salivary CgA concentration levels after 30 min of mental stress load tasks. This anti-stress effect of black tea aroma did not differ between the two tea types even though the concentration of the anti-stress components in the Darjeeling tea aroma was higher than that in the Assam aroma. However, Darjeeling tea aroma tended to decrease the tension and/or anxiety score immediately after the first exposure.                  Conclusions:                    Inhaling black tea aroma may diminish stress levels caused by arithmetic mental stress tasks, and Darjeeling tea aroma tended to improve mood before mental stress load.

green tea,The influence of stress at puberty on mood and learning: role of the α4βδ GABAA receptor - PubMed,"              It is well-known that the onset of puberty is associated with changes in mood as well as cognition. Stress can have an impact on these outcomes, which in many cases, can be more influential in females, suggesting that gender differences exist. The adolescent period is a vulnerable time for the onset of certain psychopathologies, including anxiety disorders, depression and eating disorders, which are also more prevalent in females. One factor which may contribute to stress-triggered anxiety at puberty is the GABAA receptor (GABAR), which is known to play a pivotal role in anxiety. Expression of α4βδ GABARs increases on the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells at the onset of puberty in the hippocampus, part of the limbic circuitry which governs emotion. This receptor is a sensitive target for the stress steroid 3α-OH-5[α]β-pregnan-20-one or [allo]pregnanolone, which paradoxically reduces inhibition and increases anxiety during the pubertal period (post-natal day ∼35-44) of female mice in contrast to its usual effect to enhance inhibition and reduce anxiety. Spatial learning and synaptic plasticity are also adversely impacted at puberty, likely a result of increased expression of α4βδ GABARs on the dendritic spines of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells, which are essential for consolidation of memory. This review will focus on the role of these receptors in mediating behavioral changes at puberty. Stress-mediated changes in mood and cognition in early adolescence may have relevance for the expression of psychopathologies in adulthood.          "
green tea,"Correlations Between Nutrition Habits, Anxiety and Metabolic Parameters in Greek Healthy Adults - PubMed","        Background:                    Anxiety combined with nervousness and apprehension consist a focal response to different life conditions. Lifestyle habits, anxiety and biochemical markers are in a constant interaction.                  Aim:                    To investigate the prevalence of anxiety in healthy adults and its possible association with biochemical factors-lipid profile, liver markers, thyroid hormones-and lifestyle habits.                  Methods:                    Quantitative descriptive correlation study. A total of 100 healthy adults participated in the research. A specially designed questionnaire and Hamilton's scale were used. Anthropometric and biochemical analyses were performed.                  Findings:                    Overall, 61% of the participants presented moderate to very serious anxiety. The average score on the Hamilton scale was 13.82 (±9.000), with men exhibiting less stress than women. For p ≤ 0.05: Stress was positively correlated with impaired thyroid and hepatic function. Hepatic function was affected by both sugar products and water melon, which were positively correlated with total bilirubin and AST/SGOT respectively. Tomato, peppers and legumes were negatively correlated with AST/SGOT. Deep fried food was positively correlated with GGT and triglycerides. Legumes and fish were negatively correlated with CPK. Regarding the lipid metabolism, it was found that food cooked with oil was positively associated with uric acid, but non-cooked olive oil was negatively correlated with the risk for CAD. Thyroid function was negatively correlated with non-homemade food and pasta consumption and positively correlated with consumption of whole grains and green tea. Participants with subclinical hypothyroidism seemed to consume less vitamin B12, folic acid and vegetables.                  Conclusion:                    No direct correlation between lifestyle habits and anxiety was found. Nevertheless, eating habits influenced biochemical markers-especially the thyroid hormones-which may be indirectly responsible for anxiety and related moods.          "
green tea,"Effects of Epigallocatechin Gallate on Behavioral and Cognitive Impairments, Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Dysfunction, and Alternations in Hippocampal BDNF Expression Under Single Prolonged Stress - PubMed","              Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a traumatic stress-related psychiatric disorder stimulated by experience. Green tea has potent antioxidative properties, due, in part, to the catechin (-) epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). EGCG is an important polyphenol with advantageous effects on anxiety and depression. Nevertheless, the mechanism about the inhibition of PTSD-like symptoms of EGCG is still unidentified. We examined whether EGCG improved learning and memory deficit stimulated in rats after single prolonged stress (SPS). Rats were administrated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with EGCG for 14 successive days after the SPS process. The SPS procedure stimulated cognitive deficit in the Morris water maze test and the object recognition task, and this impairment was improved by EGCG (25 mg/kg, i.p.). Daily EGCG administration significantly decreased the freezing response to contextual fear conditioning. The administration of EGCG also significantly moderated memory-related decreases in the alternation of cAMP-response element-binding protein and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that EGCG alleviated SPS-stimulated learning and memory deficit by inhibiting the increase of neuroinflammation in the rat brain. In addition, EGCG reversed the alternation of allopregnanolone and progesterone in the brain, and diminished simultaneously the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction. Thus, EGCG reversed learning and memory-related behavioral dysfunction and molecular alternation accelerated by traumatic stress and may be a useful therapeutic material for PTSD.          "
green tea,[Management of infantile colics] - PubMed,"              Infantile colic concerns about 10-30% of all newborns and has been defined as a condition characterized by paroxysmal episodes of unexplained full force crying for at least three days a week and continuing for one week or more in a thriving well-nourished infant. The disorder more likely occurs in the evening, without identifiable causes and resolves spontaneously by the fourth month of life. The several factors involved in the etiopathogenesis (food intolerance or allergy to cow's milk protein, intolerance to lactose, intestinal hyperperistalsis, neuro-hormonal immaturity, maternal anxiety and familial stress), make the management of infants with colics difficult. We propose a scoring system for the evaluation of colics in infants based on: 1) crying intensity and duration; 2) accompanying characteristics of crises (e.g. meteorism, family history for allergic disease, type of feeding, type of stools); 3) evaluation of parents' opinion of their infants' crying. Type of management is based on the score: a) crying that is unrelated to colics: treatments referred to specific diagnosis. b) crying that is related to colics but not severe: first and second step of management; c) crying that is related to colics and is severe: third step of management.                  Management:                    first step: pacifier, rocking, dull continuous background noise, hot water bottle on the abdomen, herbal tea, simethicone. Second step: pharmacological treatment and periodic controls. Pharmacological treatment include antispastic drugs (e.g. cimetropium bromide). Third step: dietary modification and/or pharmacological treatment: mothers of breast-fed infants are given a diet with no milk or products containing its proteins, or fish, or eggs. Infants who are not breast-fed receive soy milk and if symptoms continue soy milk is substituted with hydrolyzed casein milk formula. Pharmacological treatment include antispastic drugs (e.g. cimetropium bromide and in non responders dicyclomine hydrochloride). Dietary modifications appear more suitable than pharmacological treatment in resolving symptoms, since side effects of drugs have been described and our recent results indicate appropriate dietary modifications offer better results than pharmacological treatment in resolving crises. However, before interrupting dietary modifications and reintroducing cow's milk proteins, infant's tolerance to such proteins is tested. In any case because of the good prognosis and rapid regression of symptoms, dietary regimens or pharmacological treatment should only be applied if really necessary and for brief periods under medical supervision.

green tea,Correlation between lifestyle and social factors in functional dyspepsia among college freshmen - PubMed,"        Objective:                    We aimed to examine the relationship between the prevalence of functional dyspepsia (FD) and lifestyle habits, to identify social factors that may contribute to psychosocial disorders.                  Methods:                    We enrolled 759 university freshmen in this study, who were categorized into the FD group and healthy group. All participants completed the validated Self-Rating Depression Scale and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale questionnaires, to assess lifestyle and social factors among participants.                  Results:                    The proportion of participants with FD was 16.86%, and 67.97% were women. Diet irregularities and sleep impairment may have an effect on FD. Tea consumption may play a role in preventing FD. Participants with FD were more likely to have mood disorders than healthy participants. Most participants with FD who had mood disorders experienced mild anxiety or depression. Participants' main sources of stress arose from daily life, development, social life, life events, and participants' daily schedule.                  Conclusion:                    Sex and lifestyle habits, including sleeping patterns and dietary habits, can have an impact on FD. Social stress and mood disorders also have an effect on FD. FD may be prevented by adjusting lifestyle habits and psychological counseling.          "
green tea,Amelioration of behavioral aberrations and oxidative markers by green tea extract in valproate induced autism in animals - PubMed,"              Exposure to toxicants prenatally and postnatally could have deleterious consequences on the offspring. Postnatal exposure to valproate in mice pups is capable of inducing experimental autism resulting in neurobehavioral aberrations. Consumption of green tea has been associated with neuronal protection against the impact of toxicants. We investigated the role of green tea extract in reversing cardinal behavioral changes and aberrations in oxidative stress induced by valproate exposure. Young mice of both genders received a single dose of valproate (400mg/kg subcutaneously) on postnatal day 14 followed by a daily dose of green tea extract (75 and 300mg/kg) orally up to postnatal day 40. Mice pups were subjected to behavioral testing to assess motor co-ordination, nociceptive response, locomotion, anxiety, exploratory activity and cognition on various postnatal days up to postnatal day 40. At the end of behavioral testing, blood was withdrawn from the retro orbital plexus for the estimation of lipid peroxides. Animals were sacrificed on postnatal day 41 and whole brain was subjected to histopathological examination. Our studies revealed a significant improvement in behavioral assessments particularly with 300mg/kg of green tea extract. Formation of markers of oxidative stress was reduced at both dose levels. Histological findings confirm the neuroprotective effect of green tea at a dose of 300mg/kg. In conclusion it can be stated that green tea exerts neuronal cytoprotective action possibly due to anti-oxidant action and could be efficacious in the management of autism.          "
green tea,Psychosocial-spiritual factors in patients with functional dyspepsia: a comparative study with normal individuals having the same endoscopic features - PubMed,"        Objectives:                    The aim of the study is to identify factors that are associated with dyspeptic symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia (FD) in a multivariate context.                  Methods:                    Demographic data, personal habits, stressful life events, and psychological distress were compared between functional dyspeptic patients with gastric reddish streaks and asymptomatic counterparts who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy as part of a self-paid physical check-up.                  Results:                    There were 93 patients in the symptomatic group and 67 patients in the asymptomatic group. FD patients had a lower proportion of tea consumption (38 vs. 61%, P = 0.004), more were single (20 vs. 6%, P<0.05), less belief in religion (46 vs. 66%, P<0.05), a greater number (median+/-interquartile range, 3.0+/-2.0 vs. 2.0+/-2.0, P<0.001) and more severity (1.5+/-0.9 vs. 1.0+/-1.0, P<0.001) with regard to stressful life events, greater scores of symptom dimensions of somatization, depression, anxiety, and psychotism and general severity index of psychopathology as compared with asymptomatic counterparts. Only tea consumption [odds ratio (OR) = 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.15-0.72, P<0.01)], religion (OR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.19-0.91, P<0.05), number of stressful life events (OR = 2.74, 95% CI = 1.28-5.88, P<0.01), and somatization (OR = 6.80, 95% CI = 1.21-38.08, P<0.05) remained statistically significant in multivariate analysis.                  Conclusion:                    FD with gastric reddish streaks exhibited increased somatization, more stressful life events, less belief in religion, and less tea consumption as compared with asymptomatic counterparts. The findings of the study suggest the importance of adopting a more comprehensive holistic bio-psycho-socio-spiritual model when dealing with FD patients.          "
green tea,"[Triggers of bulimia and compulsion attacks: validation of the ""Start"" questionnaire] - PubMed","        Aim:                    There are few published studies on the triggers of binge eating in anorexia nervosa of binge/purging subtype (BPAN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED).                  Patients and methods:                    We validated in 29 patients (10 BPAN, 10 BN and 9 BED) the perspicuity, the clarity and the intra- (doubles) and inter- (test-retest) reproducibility of a 24-item Start questionnaire on the triggers of binge eating. Then the Start questionnaire was administered to 176 patients (65 BPAN, 62 BN and 59 BED patients) being 27.5+9.1 yr old, having 15+9 binge eating (BE) episodes/week, with a mean binge duration of 1 hr 36min (+ 38min)/day.                  Results:                    BE episodes occurred mainly during the second part of the day: afternoon after work (67% of the patients), ""tea"" time (55%), evening after dinner (42%) and at night (22%). The principal place for BE episodes was at home (96%). The BED patients avoided binges at the parents' home (89%) more often than the BPAN (62%, P<0.02). The binges occurred mainly in the living room (44%), in the kitchen (43%), and less in the bedroom (31%). Hunger pangs seemed to be a trigger of binges in 31% of the patients, and a stronger trigger in BED (42%) than in the BPAN and BN patients (24%; P=0.04). Binge eating episodes could occur despite a high satiety level (just after lunch or dinner) in 29% of the BN and in 16% of the BED patients (P<0.02). Concerning food, the major triggers were high energy-density food (77%) and comfort food (60%), such as chocolate, cakes, bread and pasta. The food consumed for binge episodes (in-binge food) was more often a strong trigger than the other food (not used for binges): olfaction (19% versus 10%), sight (52% versus 25%) and placing in the mouth (71% versus 26%; P<0.02 for all, in the 3 groups). Being tired could be a strong trigger in 37% of the patients, but ""being aroused"" in the other 38 % of the patients. Stressful events (65%), anxiety (74%), ""being under pressure"" or irritated (51% and 55%) were of course major triggers in a majority of the patients, as well as sadness (61%), feeling of powerlessness (62%), inefficiency (73%) and depressive state (71%). Flashback from traumatism (sexual trauma in 17% of the patients) was a strong trigger of binges more often in BPAN and BED (44%) than in BN (23%; P<0.05). The binge eating was painful (and ""not at all a pleasure"") in 69% of the patients, but could also be a relaxing behavior in 31% of the patients, more often in the BED (43%) than in the BPAN patients (20%; P<0.05). The binge eating behavior was quoted as obsessive in 63% of BPAN, 92% of BN and only 34% of BED patients (P<0.001). The patients said that they were unable to avoid the binge (76% of the patients), more often in BPAN and BN than in BED patients (P<0.01). As a whole, 62% of BPAN, 89% of BN and only 4 % of BED patients (P<0.05) were unable to avoid purging (vomiting). In 12% of the cases, there was a pleasure felt when binging. For the other patients, shame, filth and incapacity were the feelings related to binges in 58% of the BPAN, 45% of BN and 43% of BED patients (P<0.04). The global score of addiction (zero=not addicted, 10=very addicted) was 8.56+1.2 in BPAN, 8.42+1.5 in BN and 6.74+1.1 in BED patients (NS between BPAN and BN; P<0.01 between BPAN and BN on the one hand and BED on the other).                  Conclusion:                    The present study has demonstrated the usefulness of the Start questionnaire. It also evidences the key role of intrinsic factors, both metabolic and emotional, as strong triggers for binge eating episodes in BPAN, BN and BED. It has also demonstrated the role of environmental determinants.          "
green tea,Catechin ameliorates depressive symptoms in Sprague Dawley rats subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress by decreasing oxidative stress - PubMed,"              Catechin is an active ingredient of green tea. It is reported to inhibit corticosteroid-induced anxiety and depression-like symptoms. Considering the complex nature of depression, effects of catechin need to be studied in a clinically relevant depression model. The present study was designed to explore the antidepressant effect of catechin in Sprague Dawley rats subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Animals were subjected to CUMS and treated with (+)-catechin (50 mg/kg) or escitalopram (10 mg/kg) orally; a CUMS control and a vehicle control that was not exposed to CUMS were also established. Various stressors were applied daily in an unpredictable manner for 8 weeks achieve CUMS. Sucrose preference test were performed after 4 and 8 weeks and forced swim tests (FSTs) were conducted at weeks 4, 6 and 8. At the end of week 8, animals were sacrificed and the brain homogenate was studied for antioxidant parameters. Compared with the vehicle control, animals of the CUMS control group showed a significant decrease in sucrose intake. Catechin and escitalopram treatment significantly improved the sucrose intake compared with the CUMS control. A similar trend was observed in the FSTs, where catechin and escitalopram treatment significantly reduced the immobility time, and antioxidant parameters, including catalase, glutathione and superoxide dismutase levels were recovered in treated animals compared with the CUMS control. Thus, it was concluded that catechin reverses CUMS-induced depression in rats by ameliorating oxidative stress, which may help to develop a novel treatment for major depressive disorder.          "
green tea,The Effects of Green Tea Amino Acid L-Theanine Consumption on the Ability to Manage Stress and Anxiety Levels: a Systematic Review - PubMed,"              The green tea amino acid, L-theanine (L-THE) is associated with several health benefits, including improvements in mood, cognition and a reduction of stress and anxiety-like symptoms. This systematic review evaluated the effect of pure L-THE intake, in the form of orally administered nutritional supplements, on stress responses and anxiety levels in human randomised controlled trials. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist, 9 peer-reviewed journal articles were identified where L-THE as a supplement was compared to a control. Our findings suggest that supplementation of 200-400 mg/day of L-THE may assist in the reduction of stress and anxiety in people exposed to stressful conditions. Despite this finding, longer-term and larger cohort clinical studies, including those where L-THE is incorporated into the diet regularly, are needed to clinically justify the use of L-THE as a therapeutic agent to reduce stress and anxiety in people exposed to stressful conditions.

green tea,Opinions in Denmark on the causes of peptic ulcer disease. A survey among Danish physicians and patients - PubMed,"              The aim of the study was to investigate opinions among Danish patients and physicians on causes of peptic ulcer disease. Fifty-nine patients with an ulcer history and 77 physicians with a special interest in gastroenterology participated. They were given a questionnaire listing 16 possible causes of peptic ulcer and indicated for each whether they believed it was a contributory cause of the disease. The patients stated 0-10 causes each (median, 4), and the physicians 3-12 causes (median, 6) (p < 0.01). Younger physicians stated more causes than did the older ones (p < 0.01), and female physicians stated more causes than did their male colleagues (p < 0.01). Seventy-five per cent of the patients indicated that psychologic factors, such as grief, anxiety, and stress, were contributory causes of peptic ulcer disease, whereas only around 40% believed that coffee/tea, alcohol, smoking, side effects of medicine, and working conditions played a causal role. Around 95% of the physicians indicated that medical drugs and smoking were contributory causes of peptic ulcer disease, and around 80% that alcohol and psychologic factors were so. Only 30-40% of the physicians believed that coffee/tea, food habits, infection, and working conditions could play a causal role in ulcer disease. It is concluded that the opinion on causal agents in peptic ulcer disease differ considerably among both patients and physicians. Opinions on causes of diseases may influence the way we treat and advise our patients, and attempts should thus be made to unify our knowledge and interpretations of causes of diseases to reach more solid ground in counselling our patients.

green tea,"Anti-Stress, Behavioural and Magnetoencephalography Effects of an L-Theanine-Based Nutrient Drink: A Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Trial - PubMed","              L-theanine (γ-glutamylethylamide) is an amino acid found primarily in the green tea plant. This study explored the effects of an L-theanine-based nutrient drink on mood responses to a cognitive stressor. Additional measures included an assessment of cognitive performance and resting state alpha oscillatory activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Thirty-four healthy adults aged 18-40 participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced crossover study. The primary outcome measure, subjective stress response to a multitasking cognitive stressor, was significantly reduced one hour after administration of the L-theanine drink when compared to placebo. The salivary cortisol response to the stressor was reduced three hours post-dose following active treatment. No treatment-related cognitive performance changes were observed. Resting state alpha oscillatory activity was significantly greater in posterior MEG sensors after active treatment compared to placebo two hours post-dose; however, this effect was only apparent for those higher in trait anxiety. This change in resting state alpha oscillatory activity was not correlated with the change in subjective stress response or the cortisol response, suggesting further research is required to assess the functional relevance of these treatment-related changes in resting alpha activity. These findings further support the anti-stress effects of L-theanine.          "
green tea,"D-Galactose High-Dose Administration Failed to Induce Accelerated Aging Changes in Neurogenesis, Anxiety, and Spatial Memory on Young Male Wistar Rats - PubMed","              The model of accelerated senescence with the prolonged administration of d-galactose is used in anti-aging studies because it mimics several aging-associated alterations such as increase of oxidative stress and decline of cognition. However, there is no standardized protocol for this aging model, and recently some reports have questioned its effectiveness. To clarify this issue, we used a model of high-dose d-galactose on 1-month-old male Wistar rats and studied the hippocampus, one of the most affected brain regions. In one group (n = 10), d-galactose was daily administered intraperitoneally (300 mg/kg) during 8 weeks whereas age-matched controls (n = 10) were injected intraperitoneally with saline. A third group (n = 10) was treated with the same dose of d-galactose and with oral epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) (2 grams/L), a green tea catechin with anti-oxidant and neuroprotective properties. After treatments, animals were submitted to open-field, elevated plus-maze and Morris water maze tests, and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus subgranular layer was quantified. There were no significant alterations when the three groups were compared in the number of doublecortin- and Ki-67-immunoreactive cells, and also on anxiety levels, spatial learning, and memory. Therefore, d-galactose was not effective in the induction of accelerated aging, and EGCG administered to d-galactose-treated animals did not improve behavior and had no effects on neurogenesis. We conclude that daily 300 mg/kg of d-galactose administered intraperitoneally may not be a suitable model for inducing age-related neurobehavioral alterations in young male Wistar rats. More studies are necessary to obtain a reliable and reproducible model of accelerated senescence in rodents using d-galactose.           "
green tea,Prevention of bladder cancer incidence and recurrence: nutrition and lifestyle - PubMed,"        Purpose of review:                    We review the influence of nutrition and lifestyle on bladder cancer incidence and recurrence and summarize food items, diets and lifestyle practices that physicians may wish to prioritize for discussion with their patients.                  Recent findings:                    Recent study results suggest an association between bladder cancer incidence and several food items including meat, fruit, vegetables, milk products and oil. Micronutrient deficiency is associated with bladder cancer risk; however, it remains unclear if micronutrient supplementation can modify bladder cancer incidence. Furthermore, total fluid intake, alcohol, coffee and tea seem to have no influence on bladder cancer incidence. There is weak evidence that stress, anxiety and lack of sleep may increase the risk of developing bladder cancer, whereas exercise may reduce the risk of dying from it.                  Summary:                    Several dietary items and life styles are associated with bladder cancer incidence and recurrence. However, besides smoking cessation, there is no evidence that a certain diet or lifestyle can decrease bladder cancer incidence.          "
green tea,New horizons in local anesthesia - PubMed,"              The computer-controlled local anesthesia system and the TEA system present 21st-century alternatives to the traditional syringe. The TEA system is a non-invasive form of anesthesia that blocks pain electronically, using the same cellular mechanism as local chemical anesthesia. Targeted electronic anesthesia provides pain control for restorative dental procedures without the use of needles or postoperative discomfort, numbness, and swelling. The computer-assisted system outperforms syringes for traditional injections. This new system generates a precisely controlled anesthetic flow rate that eliminates the need for the operator to use thumb pressure to administer the injection. The lightweight pen-grasp handle results in greater tactile feedback, precision, operator ease, and patient comfort. The greatest advantage may be in the new techniques that it makes available. With these techniques, a dentist can target the teeth to achieve profound pulpal anesthesia, often without the annoying side effects of facial numbness. With this new advanced system in the maxillary arch, the AMSA injection offers clinical advantages over traditional anesthesia techniques, according to Dr. Mark Friedman, whom I consulted with earlier this year. In the mandibular arch, a safe and predictable PDL injection technique may replace the need for an inferior alveolar block in numerous clinical situations. The use of these modified injection techniques can have a positive influence on patient safety, patient comfort, and office productivity. Both of these systems take the fear and anxiety out of dental injections. They offer exciting advanced technology for local pain control. Significantly, if patient stress and anxiety are reduced, the operator immediately benefits. New horizons in local anesthesia offer improved opportunities for patient comfort using computer-controlled local anesthetic systems and TEA.          "
green tea,[Neurobiological effects of theanine and its possible use in neurology and psychiatry] - PubMed,"              Theanine is an analog of glutamate and the major aminoacid in green tea. It has received growing attention in recent years because of its beneficial effects on the central nervous system. Theanine was shown to increase levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and to stimulate neurogenesis. Anti-stress and calming effects of theanine are the most apparent and well-studied. A number of studies showed neuroprotective effects of theanine after an ischemic cerebral injury or the exposure to toxic chemicals. It also improved cognitive function including attention, memory and learning. Recent studies demonstrated a promising role of theanine in augmentation therapy for major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. Theoretical grounds for using theanine in treatment of bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder and some neurodegenerative disorders are discussed.          "

green tea,Psychotropic effects of L-theanine and its clinical properties: From the management of anxiety and stress to a potential use in schizophrenia - PubMed,"              Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in modern societies, and are ranked the sixth most important contributor of non-fatal negative health outcomes. L-theanine is an amino acid naturally found in green tea (Camellia sinensis) and some other plant extracts, and recent clinical studies have proposed promising adjuvant effects of L-theanine for the negative impact of anxiety and psychological stress on health. In this integrative narrative review, we aimed to appraise and further discuss the effects of L-theanine administration on anxiety disorders and psychological stress. Published data suggests that L-theanine administered at daily doses ranging from 200 to 400 mg for up to 8 weeks are safe and induce anxiolytic and anti-stress effects in acute and chronic conditions. L-theanine at doses lower and higher than these may also show promising therapeutic potential; however, a more thorough investigation through randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover clinical trials are necessary to elucidate its effects for longer periods, providing further insights for meta-analyses and the development of recommendation guidelines. Additionally, animal studies investigating a higher dosage, its combination with other pharmacological compounds and associated metabolic comorbidities are recommended, as cases of hepatotoxicity associated with the consumption of green tea extract have been reported.

green tea,"Effects on birth weight of smoking, alcohol, caffeine, socioeconomic factors, and psychosocial stress - PubMed","        Objective:                    To investigate the effects of smoking, alcohol, and caffeine consumption and socio-economic factors and psychosocial stress on birth weight.                  Design:                    Prospective population study.                  Setting:                    District general hospital in inner London.                  Participants:                    A consecutive series of 1860 white women booking for delivery were approached. 136 Refused and 211 failed to complete the study for other reasons (moved, abortion, subsequent refusal), leaving a sample of 1513. Women who spoke no English, booked after 24 weeks, had insulin dependent diabetes, or had a multiple pregnancy were excluded.                  Measurements:                    Data were obtained by research interviewers at booking (general health questionnaire, modified Paykel's interview, and Eysenck personality questionnaire) and at 17, 28, and 36 weeks' gestation and from the structured antenatal and obstetric record. Variables assessed included smoking, alcohol consumption, caffeine consumption, and over 40 indicators of socio-economic state and psychosocial stress, including social class, tenure of accommodations, education, employment, income, anxiety and depression, stressful life events, social stress, social support, personality, and attitudes to pregnancy. Birth weight was corrected for gestation and adjusted for maternal height, parity, and baby's sex.                  Main results:                    Smoking was the most important single factor (5% reduction in corrected birth weight). Passive smoking was not significant (0.5% reduction). After smoking was controlled for, alcohol had an effect only in smokers and the effects of caffeine became non-significant. Only four of the socioeconomic and stress factors significantly reduced birth weight and these effects became non-significant after smoking was controlled for.                  Conclusions:                    Social and psychological factors have little or no direct effect on birth weight corrected for gestational age (fetal growth), and the main environmental cause of its variation in this population was smoking.

green tea,Rose tea for relief of primary dysmenorrhea in adolescents: a randomized controlled trial in Taiwan - PubMed,"              Primary dysmenorrhea occurs in as many as 50% of female adolescents and is associated with significant decreases in academic performance, sports participation, and socialization with peers. Complementary and alternative medicine treatment options are of interest to patients and health care providers. The use of rose tea to alleviate menstrual pain has long been a part of folk knowledge around the world but has not been studied scientifically. To determine the effectiveness of drinking rose tea as an intervention for reducing pain and psychophysiologic distress in adolescents with primary dysmenorrhea, 130 female adolescents were randomly assigned to an experimental (n = 70) and a control (n = 60) group. Preintervention and postintervention data at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months were gathered on the biopsychosocial outcomes of dysmenorrhea. The results showed that compared with the control group, the experimental group perceived less menstrual pain, distress, and anxiety and showed greater psychophysiologic well-being through time, at 1, 3, and 6 months after the interventions. Findings suggest that drinking rose tea is a safe, readily available, and simple treatment for dysmenorrhea, which female adolescents may take to suit their individual needs.          "
green tea,"Camellia sinensis Prevents Perinatal Nicotine-Induced Neurobehavioral Alterations, Tissue Injury, and Oxidative Stress in Male and Female Mice Newborns - PubMed","              Nicotine exposure during pregnancy induces oxidative stress and leads to behavioral alterations in early childhood and young adulthood. The current study aimed to investigate the possible protective effects of green tea (Camellia sinensis) against perinatal nicotine-induced behavioral alterations and oxidative stress in mice newborns. Pregnant mice received 50 mg/kg C. sinensis on gestational day 1 (PD1) to postnatal day 15 (D15) and were subcutaneously injected with 0.25 mg/kg nicotine from PD12 to D15. Nicotine-exposed newborns showed significant delay in eye opening and hair appearance and declined body weight at birth and at D21. Nicotine induced neuromotor alterations in both male and female newborns evidenced by the suppressed righting, rotating, and cliff avoidance reflexes. Nicotine-exposed newborns exhibited declined memory, learning, and equilibrium capabilities, as well as marked anxiety behavior. C. sinensis significantly improved the physical development, neuromotor maturation, and behavioral performance in nicotine-exposed male and female newborns. In addition, C. sinensis prevented nicotine-induced tissue injury and lipid peroxidation and enhanced antioxidant defenses in the cerebellum and medulla oblongata of male and female newborns. In conclusion, this study shows that C. sinensis confers protective effects against perinatal nicotine-induced neurobehavioral alterations, tissue injury, and oxidative stress in mice newborns.

green tea,Development of species-specific chloroplast markers for the authentication of Gynostemma pentaphyllum and their distribution in the Korean peninsula - PubMed,"              Gynostemma pentaphyllum is a traditional oriental medicinal herb used as tea since ancient time. Among Gynostemma species, G. pentaphyllum has more active chemical components and better therapeutic effect. It is used to cure depression, diabetes, anxiety, hyperlipidemia, fatigue, immunity, cancer, and oxidative stress. Overexploitation of G. pentaphyllum for its medicinal benefits has been on a rise, due to which they are adulterated or mistakenly identified with other members of Gynostemma species. Hence, we used chloroplast universal regions such as ycf3, accD, petD, psbB and their polymorphism to distinguish G. pentaphyllum from other Gynostemma species. By using the species-specific primers derived from the above regions, we established a multiplex allele-specific PCR for the authentication of G. pentaphyllum from other species. Thus the PCR reaction produced unique amplicons of size 244 bp and 438 bp for G. pentaphyllum amplified by the primers flanking ycf3, and accD regions respectively. While a 607 bp, and 787 bp amplicons from the primers targeting psbB, and petD regions distinguished G. longipes, G. burmanicum, and G. pubescens species. Moreover, these primers were successful to analyze the dried tea samples of Gynostemma as well. Thus, the developed molecular markers could authenticate different Gynostemma species as well as its products thereby preventing the mistaken-identity of this medicinal herb.          "
green tea,Identification and quantification of the sedative and anticonvulsant flavone glycoside from Chrysanthemum boreale - PubMed,"              The flowers or leaves of Chrysanthemum boreale (Compositae) have been traditionally used as herb tea to reduce anxiety, insomnia, and stress. Sedative and anticonvulsant activities were evaluated in mice using pentobarbital-induced sleeping assay and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced convulsion assay. The flower extract exhibited more potent activities than the extracts of the leaves and stems, and chromatographic isolation yielded the five compounds acacetin, linarin, acacetin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 2)[α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 6)]-β-D-glucopyranoside, chlorogenic acid, and 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid. These compounds were simultaneously analyzed by HPLC, and the method was validated. The contents of linarin, which were shown to be most abundant in C. boreale, were observed in the order of leaf (11.93 mg/g) > flower (8.50 mg/g) > stem (5.60 mg/g). Linarin and its aglycone, acacetin, exhibited sedative and anticonvulsant activities in the present in vivo assays. It can be considered that linarin is one of the active compounds effective against anxiety, insomnia, and stress, with acacetin as its active moiety.          "
green tea,"Prevalence and Predictors of Depression, Anxiety and Stress Symptoms in Paramedics at Saudi Red Crescent Authority - PubMed","        Background:                    Emergency medical professionals often encounter situations when dealing with patients that can affect their mental health. In Saudi Arabia, there is paucity of data regarding the mental health of paramedics involved in prehospital care.                  Objectives:                    To determine the prevalence and predictors of stress, anxiety and depression symptoms among paramedics working at Saudi Red Crescent Authority (SRCA) stations in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.                  Methods:                    This cross-sectional, questionnaire study included all paramedics working in the prehospital medical services of 21 SRCA stations in Riyadh (N = 300) between March and June 2017. Sociodemographic data were collected using a self-reporting questionnaire, and the Arabic version of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 was used to identify the states of stress, anxiety and depression. Bivariate analysis using chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to determine the association between sociodemographic factors and mental health.                  Results:                    In total, 240 emergency medical professionals responded (response rate = 80%). Of these, 30.5% had stress, 40% had anxiety and 26.7% had depression. All cases of stress were of mild-to-moderate level, while 5.1% of the respondents had severe-to-extremely severe anxiety and 1.3% had severe depression; there were no cases of extremely severe depression. Number of mission calls was identified as a predictor for stress and anxiety; intake of medications for noncommunicable diseases as a predictor for stress and depression; hours of sleep/day for anxiety and depression and use of stimulant beverages other than tea, coffee and energy drinks as predictors for anxiety.                  Conclusion:                    This study demonstrates that stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms are relatively common in paramedics working at SRCA stations in Riyadh. The authors suggest that the above-mentioned predictors should be monitored in paramedics and interventions should be made when necessary.          "
green tea,A successful approach to conrol burning mouth syndrome using matricaria recutita and cognitive therapy - PubMed,"              The burning mouth syndrome (BMS) has no specific clinical and laboratory signs. Its etiology is yet to be elucidated, but it is considered to be affected by multifactorial, psychological, and local and systemic factors. This condition is considered of great morbidity, and the main complaint of patients maybe associated with xerostomia, thirst, and altered taste. The present study aims to report two cases of BMS and to evaluate the outcome of cognitive therapy (CT) plus phytotherapy in the control of BMS. The patients were female, Caucasian, and aged between 58 and 69 years. The most BMS-affected anatomical parts were the lips and the tongue. In the clinical approach, oral and systemic evaluation, and disease management with CT plus chamomile tea were done. The patients were reassured, and their response to therapy one year after was found to be excellent despite few exacerbations in periods of great emotional stress. Thus, we conclude that psychological treatment is vital in the management of BMS, as CT, along with Matricaria recutita phytotherapy, displayed excellent results in the control of BMS. Key words:Anxiety, chamomile tea, xerostomia, psychosomatic.          "
green tea,"Anxiety levels in cancer patients and ""life sound"" experience - PubMed","        Aims and background:                    For the hospitalized cancer patient, time takes on a rhythm which is very different from the external reality. Based on the idea that time represents a fundamental dimension of human existence and is connected to future plans, time spent waiting and memories, we carried out this experience entitled ""Life Sound"" project. The objectives of the project were to experiment different and unusual ways of spending time in hospital in order to improve the quality of life of the hospitalized cancer patient, to help the patient adapt to the hospital environment, to encourage awareness of self and to give a different meaning to time spent in the hospital. In particular, we evaluated the reduction in the levels of anxiety, in psychological suffering and the improvement in communication.                  Methods:                    We met with patients, family members, friends, volunteers and department personnel (doctors, psychologists, nurses) in a room in the Oncology and Hematology Department set aside specifically for recreation activities such as having a cup of tea while listening to music, talking, joking, listening to people's memories and celebrating birthdays, anniversaries and other special days. The study, which involved 109 patients, was carried out through the use of the questionnaire STAI-Y distributed before and after the event.                  Results:                    The results showed a statistically significant difference in anxiety levels 2 hrs before participation (mean = 38.33) and 2 hrs after participation (mean = 34.77) in the program. This variation was also assessed based on gender, age, cancer stage, time since diagnosis and performance status but did not result in any statistically significant difference.                  Conclusions:                    The ""Life Sound"" project encourages the emergence of positive feelings, of a renewed willingness to invest in personal and caring relationships, which are connected to the patient's ability to face this illness, and the opening of new channels of communication with family members and hospital staff.

green tea,Neurochemical and behavioral effects of green tea (Camellia sinensis): a model study - PubMed,"              Being rich in polyphenolic compounds such as flavonoids, green tea is suggested to be a potential candidate for the treatment of obesity, stress, depression, Parkinson's and other disorders. Since serotonin has an important role in the pathophysiology of these disorders, present study was designed to monitor the effects of green tea in rats. Green tea extract was provided to the male Albino Wistar rats for 5 weeks, and effects on behaviors were monitored. Results show a decrease in food intake after 5th week but not before. An increase in locomotive activities of the animals was observed, as monitored in novel as well as in familiar environment. Anxiolytic effects were observed in elevated plus maze but not in light dark activity box. An increase in dopamine and serotonin turnover was observed. Our results suggest that beneficial effects of green tea drinking might be due to alteration of serotonin and/or dopamine metabolism. We thereby propose that in further experiments, green tea should be administered in animal model of learned helplessness and effects on the development of adaptation to stress should be monitored. Neurochemical estimations of catecholamine and indoleamine in these animal models of stress exposed to green tea would help in understanding the anxiolytic effects of green tea.          "
green tea,Anti-stress Effect of Green Tea with Lowered Caffeine on Humans: A Pilot Study - PubMed,"              Theanine, an amino acid in tea, has significant anti-stress effects on animals and humans. However, the effect of theanine was blocked by caffeine and gallate-type catechins, which are the main components in tea. We examined the anti-stress effect of green tea with lowered caffeine, low-caffeine green tea, on humans. The study design was a single-blind group comparison and participants (n=20) were randomly assigned to low-caffeine or placebo tea groups. These teas (≥500 mL/d), which were eluted with room temperature water, were taken from 1 week prior to pharmacy practice and continued for 10 d in the practice period. The participants ingested theanine (ca. 15 mg/d) in low-caffeine green tea. To assess the anxiety of participants, the state-trait anxiety inventory test was used before pharmacy practice. The subjective stress of students was significantly lower in the low-caffeine-group than in the placebo-group during pharmacy practice. The level of salivary α-amylase activity, a stress marker, increased significantly after daily pharmacy practice in the placebo-group but not in the low-caffeine-group. These results suggested that the ingestion of low-caffeine green tea suppressed the excessive stress response of students. This study was registered at the University Hospital Medical Information Network (ID No. UMIN14942).          "
green tea,"Co-occurrence of depressive, anxiety, and somatic symptoms: trajectories from adolescence to midlife using group-based joint trajectory analysis - PubMed","        Background:                    Co-occurrence of mental and somatic symptoms is common, and recent longitudinal studies have identified single trajectories of these symptoms, but it is poorly known whether the symptom trajectories can also co-occur and change across the lifespan. We aimed to examine co-occurring symptoms and their joint trajectories from adolescence to midlife.                  Methods:                    Longitudinal data were derived from Northern Sweden, where 506 girls and 577 boys aged 16 years participated at baseline in 1981 (99.7% of those initially invited), and have been followed up in four waves until the age of 43. Survey data were collected about depressive, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. Potential joint development of this three-component symptom set was examined with multiple response trajectory analysis, a method that has not been previously used to study co-occurrence of these symptoms.                  Results:                    We identified a five trajectory solution as the best: ""very low"" (19%), ""low"" (31%), ""high"" (22%), ""late sharply increasing"" (16%) and a ""very high increasing"" (12%). In the ""late sharply increasing"" and ""very high increasing"" groups the scores tended to increase with age, while in the other groups the levels were more stable. Overall, the results indicated that depressive, anxiety, and somatic symptoms co-exist from adolescence to midlife.                  Conclusions:                    The multiple response trajectory analysis confirmed high stability in the co-occurrence of depressive, anxiety, and somatic symptoms from adolescence to midlife. Clinicians should consider these findings to detect symptoms in their earliest phase in order to prevent the development of co-occurring high levels of symptoms.          "
green tea,Neurochemical and behavioral effects of green tea (Camellia sinensis) as observed in animals exposed to restraint stress - PubMed,"              Clinical studies on psychiatric patients suggest that life events stress precipitates depression. The possible involvement of 5-Hydroxy tryptamine (5-HT; Serotonin) in depression and other behavioral deficits is also suggested by clinical studies. As a natural stimulant, green tea (Camellia Sinensis) diminishes stress, worry and anxiety, allowing the brain to focus and concentrate better. Previously we have reported that beneficial effects of green tea might be associated with altered levels of 5-HT, which in turn may help in coping with stress. Present study therefore deals with monitoring the behavior and neurochemical profile of single restrained stress in animals previously administered (for 5 weeks) with green tea. Activities in light dark activity box were monitored 1hr post restraint stress. Cumulative food intake values were monitored 24hr post restraint stress. 24hr after restrained stress, rats were decapitated to collect plasma and brain samples. Brain samples were kept stored at -70οC until neurochemical analysis by HPLC-EC. Findings illustrate that although food intake was decreased in both green tea- as well as water treated rats, stress-induced anxiogenic effects were attenuated in green tea treated rats. Tone of 5-HT was also normalized in restrained animals. Results suggest beneficial effects of green tea in coping the stressful conditions/stimuli are related to altered 5-HT metabolism.          "
green tea,Stress-Reducing Function of Matcha Green Tea in Animal Experiments and Clinical Trials - PubMed,"              Theanine, a major amino acid in green tea, exhibits a stress-reducing effect in mice and humans. Matcha, which is essentially theanine-rich powdered green tea, is abundant in caffeine. Caffeine has a strong antagonistic effect against theanine. The stress-reducing effect of matcha was examined with an animal experiment and a clinical trial. The stress-reducing effect of matcha marketed in Japan and abroad was assessed based on its composition. The stress-reducing effect of matcha in mice was evaluated as suppressed adrenal hypertrophy using territorially-based loaded stress. High contents of theanine and arginine in matcha exhibited a high stress-reducing effect. However, an effective stress-reducing outcome was only possible when the molar ratio of caffeine and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) to theanine and arginine was less than two. Participants (n = 39) consumed test-matcha, which was expected to have a stress-reducing effect, or placebo-matcha, where no effect was expected. Anxiety, a reaction to stress, was significantly lower in the test-matcha group than in the placebo group. To predict mental function of each matcha, both the quantity of theanine and the ratios of caffeine, EGCG, and arginine against theanine need to be verified.          "
green tea,Aromatherapy as an adjuvant treatment in cancer care--a descriptive systematic review - PubMed,"              Claims of benefits of aromatherapy for cancer patients include reduced anxiety levels and relief of emotional stress, pain, muscular tension and fatigue. The objective of this paper is to provide an updated descriptive, systematic review of evidence from pre-clinical and clinical trials assessing the benefits and safety of aromatherapy for cancer patients. Literature databases such as Medline (via Ovid), the Cochrane database of systematic reviews, Cochrane Central were searched from their inception until October 2010. Only studies on cancer cells or cancer patients were included. There is no long lasting effect of aromatherapy massage, while short term improvements were reported for general well being, anxiety and depression up to 8 weeks after treatment. The reviewed studies indicate short-term effects of aromatherapy on depression, anxiety and overall wellbeing. Specifically, some clinical trials found an increase in patient-identified symptom relief, psychological wellbeing and improved sleep. Furthermore, some found a short-term improvement (up to 2 weeks after treatment) in anxiety and depression scores and better pain control. Although essential oils have generally shown minimal adverse effects, potential risks include ingesting large amounts (intentional misuse); local skin irritation, especially with prolonged skin contact; allergic contact dermatitis; and phototoxicity from reaction to sunlight (some oils). Repeated topical administration of lavender and tea tree oil was associated with reversible prepubertal gynecomastia.           "
lavender,The effects of lavender aromatherapy on stress and pain perception in children during dental treatment: A randomized clinical trial - PubMed,"        Background and purpose:                    Reducing dental anxiety is a major aspect of childmanagement in dental visits. This crossover randomized clinical trial was designed to determine the effect of lavender aromatherapy on anxiety level during dental treatment and pain perception during dental injection in children.                  Materials and methods:                    Twenty-four children aged 7-9 years received restorative treatment with lavender aromatherapy in the intervention session and without aroma in the control session. Salivary cortisol and pulse rate were measured to evaluate child's anxiety level and the Face Rating Scale (FRS) was used for assessing the pain perception during injection in both visits.                  Results:                    The treatment effect on salivary cortisol, pulse rate, and FRS score was -8.01 ± 0.92 nmol/l, -11.17 ± 1.28 (in minutes), and -2.00 ± 0.41 respectively, which was statistically significant (P < 0.001).

lavender,[The effect of aroma inhalation method on stress responses of nursing students] - PubMed,"        Purpose:                    The purpose of this study is to identify the effect of aroma inhalation on stress responses (physical symptoms, levels of anxiety, perceived stresses)of nursing students.                  Method:                    This study was a quasi-experimental research using a non-equivalent pre-post design and was conducted from June 1 to June 5, 2002. The subjects consisted of 77 junior nursing students who were divided into 39 experimental group members and 38 control group members. A pretest and Post-test were conducted to measure body symptoms, the level of anxiety, and the level of perceived stress. In the experimental group, aromas were given using an aroma lamp, lavender, peppermint, rosemary and Clary-Sage. In the control group, the treatment was not administered.                  Result:                    As a result of administering aroma inhalation to nursing students, their physical symptoms decreased, their anxiety scores were low, and their perceived stress scores were low, showing that aroma inhalation could be a very effective stress management method.                  Conclusion:                    Nursing educators should play an important role in contributing to college students' physical and psychological health by helping enhance their recognition of stress management and effectively relieving their stress using essential oils.

lavender,"Examining a momentary mediation model of appearance-related stress, anxiety, and eating disorder behaviors in adult anorexia nervosa - PubMed","        Purpose:                    Appearance-related stress may result from appearance-focused events such as seeing one's reflection, seeing media images, and shopping for clothes. The purpose of this study was to examine the prospective association between momentary appearance-related stress and eating disorder (ED) behaviors (i.e., binge eating and vomiting) among women with anorexia nervosa (AN) using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). We hypothesized that appearance-related stress at Time 1 would predict binge eating and vomiting at Time 2, and that this prospective association would be mediated by momentary anxiety at Time 2 (controlling for anxiety at Time 1).                  Methods:                    Women with AN completed a 2-week EMA protocol involving repeated daily assessments of experiences and behaviors.                  Results:                    Momentary appearance-related stress preceded binge eating and vomiting, and momentary anxiety mediated the prospective association between appearance-related stress and ED behaviors.                  Conclusions:                    Targeted momentary interventions delivered in the natural environment that address appearance-related stress may have utility in the treatment of ED behaviors.

lavender,Exploring Pharmacological Mechanisms of Lavender ( Lavandula angustifolia) Essential Oil on Central Nervous System Targets - PubMed,"              Lavender essential oil is traditionally used and approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as herbal medicine to relieve stress and anxiety. Some animal and clinical studies reveal positive results in models of anxiety and depression although very little research has been done on molecular mechanisms. Our work consisted of evaluating the effects of lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) essential oil on central nervous system well-established targets, such as MAO-A, SERT, GABAAand NMDA receptors as well as in vitro models of neurotoxicity. The results showed that lavender essential oil and its main components exert affinity for the glutamate NMDA-receptor in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 0.04 μl/mL for lavender oil. In addition, lavender and linalool were also able to bind the serotonin transporter (SERT) whereas they did not show affinity for GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor. In three different models of neurotoxicity, lavender did not enhance the neurotoxic insult and improved viability of SH-SY5Y cells treated with hydrogen peroxide. According to our data, the anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects attributed to lavender may be due to an antagonism on the NMDA-receptor and inhibition of SERT. This study suggests that lavender essential oil may exert pharmacological properties via modulating the NMDA receptor, the SERT as well as neurotoxicity induced by hydrogen peroxide.          "
lavender,Essential oil of lavender in anxiety disorders: Ready for prime time? - PubMed,"              Anxiety disorders are some of the most common psychiatric disorders, with potentially debilitating consequences on individual function. Existing pharmacotherapies for anxiety disorders are limited by delay to therapeutic effect, dependence, tolerance, withdrawal, and abuse potential. Therefore, safe and evidence-based complementary or alternative therapies may be important allies in the care of patients with anxiety disorders. Essential oils are lipophilic and concentrated botanical extracts that exhibit many properties of drugs, although they are not Food and Drug Administration approved and have limitations characteristic of herbal preparations. Lavender essential oil has an extensive anecdotal history of anxiolytic benefit that has recently been supported by clinical efficacy studies. The 2 primary terpenoid constituents of lavender essential oil, linalool and linalyl acetate, may produce an anxiolytic effect in combination via inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels, reduction of 5HT1A receptor activity, and increased parasympathetic tone. The objectives of this article are to provide a brief overview of lavender oil in aromatherapy, explore variability in the constituents of lavender oil, summarize its pharmacology and safety profile, as well as describe its body of research that has been conducted for anxiety.

lavender,The Effect of Lavender Oil Application via Inhalation Pathway on Hemodialysis Patients' Anxiety Level and Sleep Quality - PubMed,"              Sleep and anxiety problems occur in hemodialysis (HD) patients due to physical symptoms, lifestyle changes, and psychosocial changes. To remove these sleep and anxiety problems, lavender oil inhalation is one of the nonpharmacological treatment options with less adverse effects than pharmacological methods. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of lavender oil application via inhalation pathway on HD patients' anxiety level and sleep quality. The study was conducted with 34 HD patients who have been on HD treatment at 2 dialysis centers. The patients of the intervention group (n = 17) were told to drip 2 drops into the box and to place it 15 to 20 cm away from the pillow, 30 minutes before going to bed for 1 week. Control group (n = 17) received no intervention. Data were collected with questionnaire form, Visual Analog Scale, and Hamilton Anxiety Assessment Scale with a face-to-face interview. Subjective sleep quality of the intervention group was higher than that of control group, mean Visual Analog Scale daytime sleepiness score declined (P < .05), and mean score of sleep duration increased (P < .001) in the intervention group. However, the differences of mean score of time for falling asleep between the 2 groups were not different. The mean score of total and subdimensions of Hamilton Anxiety Assessment Scale of intervention group and control group was significantly different (P < .001). These study results provide new promising information about the effect of lavender inhalation on sleep problems and anxiety and these have made significant contributions to nursing, especially for dialysis nurses.

lavender,Essential oils and anxiolytic aromatherapy - PubMed,"              A number of essential oils are currently in use as aromatherapy agents to relieve anxiety, stress, and depression. Popular anxiolytic oils include lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), rose (Rosa damascena), orange (Citrus sinensis), bergamot (Citrus aurantium), lemon (Citrus limon), sandalwood (Santalum album), clary sage (Salvia sclarea), Roman chamomile (Anthemis nobilis), and rose-scented geranium (Pelargonium spp.). This review discusses the chemical constituents and CNS effects of these aromatherapeutic essential oils, as well as recent studies on additional essential oils with anxiolytic activities.

lavender,Anxiolytic effects of Lavandula angustifolia odour on the Mongolian gerbil elevated plus maze - PubMed,"              Lavender is a popular treatment for stress and mild anxiety in Europe and the USA. The present study investigated the effects of (Lavandula angustifolia Mill. (Lamiaceae)) lavender odour inhalation over 2 weeks or 24 h periods, on gerbil behaviour in the elevated plus maze in mature male and female gerbils, and compared results with the effects of diazepam (1 mg/kg) i.p. after 30 min and 2-week administration. Traditional measures of open entries showed an increasing trend over the 2 weeks exposure, whereas ethological measures indicative of anxiety; stretch-attend frequency and percentage protected head-dips, were significantly lower. Exploratory behaviour, total head-dip frequency, increased after 24 h lavender and 2 weeks exposure. These results are comparable with diazepam administration. There were sex differences in protected head-dip an ethological indicator of anxiety: females showed a significant decrease in protected head-dips compared to both males and to female controls. In conclusion exposure to lavender odour may have an anxiolytic profile in gerbils similar to that of the anxiolytic diazepam. In addition, prolonged, 2-week lavender odour exposure increased exploratory behaviour in females indicating a further decrease in anxiety in this sex.          "
lavender,A Pilot Evaluation of a Smartphone Application for Workplace Depression - PubMed,"              Interventions delivered via mobile apps show particular promise in tackling the burden of common mental disorders. Appropriately targeting these interventions to at-risk populations is critical to their success. This pilot study aimed to assess the usability, feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of an app-based intervention designed to target depressive symptoms in a stressed working population. Anchored, a smartphone app including a 30-day program of mindfulness and cognitive and behavioural therapeutic components, was tested in a pre-post pilot study with participants recruited via social media advertisements. Eligible participants (N = 81) were Australian adults who were employed and reported elevated stress levels on a single-item screening measure. Follow-up assessment occurred 5 weeks after baseline. The primary outcome measure was change in depressive symptoms, with secondary outcomes measuring change in anxiety, wellbeing, stress, resilience, exercise, alcohol use, absenteeism, and work performance. User feedback and in-app data were analysed to assess engagement and intervention adherence. At follow-up, there were significant reductions in depressive symptoms (t61 = 6.35; p < 0.001) and anxiety symptoms (t60 = 7.35; p < 0.001), along with significantly reduced cases of likely new onset depression compared to baseline (24% vs. 6%, p = 0.012). Significant improvements were also seen in wellbeing (t60 = -5.64; p < 0.001), resilience (t60 = -3.89; p < 0.001), stress (t61 = 11.18; p < 0.001), and alcohol use (t60 = 3.40; p = 0.001). Participants reported no significant changes in work performance, absenteeism or exercise. There were satisfactory levels of app usability, feasibility, and acceptability. Most participants found the app easy to use (93.2%), understood the app content well (83.0%), and rated the app highly or very highly overall (72.9%). User feedback suggestions were predominantly focused on improving app navigation and user interface. This pilot study provides encouraging evidence that Anchored has potentially beneficial effects, and is usable, feasible, and acceptable as an app-based intervention for the working population experiencing elevated stress. Further testing of Anchored in a randomised controlled trial is required to investigate its efficacy as an intervention for workplace mental ill-health.          "
lavender,Parents' experiences and expectations of care in pregnancy after stillbirth or neonatal death: a metasynthesis - PubMed,"        Background:                    Pregnancy after perinatal death is characterised by elevated stress and anxiety, increasing the risk of adverse short-term and long-term outcomes.                  Objectives:                    This metasynthesis aimed to improve understanding of parents' experiences of maternity care in pregnancy after stillbirth or neonatal death.                  Search strategy:                    Six electronic databases were searched using predefined search terms.                  Selection criteria:                    English language studies using qualitative methods to explore the experiences of parents in pregnancy after perinatal loss, were included subject to quality appraisal framework.                  Data collection and analysis:                    Searches were initiated in December 2011 and finalised in March 2013. Studies were synthesised using an interpretive approach derived from meta-ethnography.                  Main results:                    Fourteen studies were included in the synthesis, graded A (no or few flaws, high trustworthiness; n = 5), B (some flaws, unlikely to affect trustworthiness; n = 5) and C (some flaws, possible impact on trustworthiness; n = 4). Three main themes were identified; co-existence of emotions, helpful and unhelpful coping activities and seeking reasssurance through interactions.                  Conclusion:                    Parents' experiences of pregnancy are profoundly altered by previous perinatal death; conflicted emotions, extreme anxiety, isolation and a lack of trust in a good outcome are commonly reported. Emotional and psychological support improves parents' experiences of subsequent pregnancy, but the absence of an evidence base may limit consistent delivery of optimal care within current services.

lavender,Testing of A Caregiver Support Team - PubMed,"        Context:                    Healthcare clinicians often endure stress over long periods of time. The burden of witnessing death and disability, complex work duties, long and irregular hours, the threat of errors, and tensions between colleagues result in emotional strain, anxiety, depression, burnout and in the worst case: suicide. The Caregiver Support Team was designed to provide emotional first aid to clinicians in the healthcare environment in the moment of need and triage those who would benefit from ongoing care.                  Objective/intervention:                    To test the feasibility of providing a Caregiver Support Team to provide emotional first aid in the workplace. This project is an extension of our previously reported Code Lavender initiative.                  Hypotheses:                    After stressful events in the workplace, staff will provide, receive, and recommend the Caregiver Support Team to others. The Caregiver Support Team will be used and accepted by clinicians, improve Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQoL) scores, general job satisfaction and feeling cared for in the workplace.                  Method/sample:                    We describe a pilot program. Following the completion of a Code Lavender pilot, physicians and staff on 4 hospital units provided nominations for peer supporters: someone they would trust in a time of emotional need. These peer supporters were provided 8 hours of training by a psychologist and voluntarily sought to find those in the workplace who were affected by workplace stress and provide emotional support. Feasibility data and ProQoL scores were collected at baseline and 3 months.                  Results:                    At baseline, 59% (n = 44) reported symptomatic stress caused by the workplace. Main causes of stress were emotional responses of patients/families, disputes with colleagues, and negative clinical outcomes. Colleagues were reported as the most frequently used source of support following workplace stress. A Caregiver Support Team intervention was received by 40% of respondents; 100% found it helpful and 100% would recommend it to others. No significant changes were demonstrated before and after the intervention in ProQoL Scores, or job satisfaction. The emotion of feeling cared-for improved. Staff spontaneously requested emotional debriefings through peer supporters. One suicide was prevented.                  Conclusions:                    The Caregiver Support Team was positively received. The organization received budgetary support from our hospital to disseminate the program system-wide. Additional interventions are needed to overcome the root cause of workplace stressors. A formal link between Risk Management is being developed to identify cases which warrant emotional (vs. clinical only or both) debriefing/group processing.          "
lavender,Aromatherapy and the central nerve system (CNS): therapeutic mechanism and its associated genes - PubMed,"              Molecular medical research on aromatherapy has been steadily increasing for use as an adjuvant therapy in managing psychiatric disorders and to examine its therapeutic mechanisms. Most studies, as well as clinically applied experience, have indicated that various essential oils, such as lavender, lemon and bergamot can help to relieve stress, anxiety, depression and other mood disorders. Most notably, inhalation of essential oils can communicate signals to the olfactory system and stimulate the brain to exert neurotransmitters (e.g. serotonin and dopamine) thereby further regulating mood. However, little research has been done on the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects, thus their mechanism of action remains ambiguous. Several hypotheses have been proposed regarding the therapeutic mechanism of depression. These have mainly centered on possible deficiencies in monoamines, neurotrophins, the neuroendocrine system, c-AMP, cation channels as well as neuroimmune interactions and epigenetics, however the precise mechanism or mechanisms related to depression have yet to be elucidated. In the current study, the effectiveness of aromatherapy for alleviating psychiatric disorders was examined using data collected from previously published studies and our unpublished data. A possible signaling pathway from olfactory system to the central nerve system and the associated key molecular elements of aromatherapy are also proposed.           "
lavender,Role of ibuprofen and lavender oil to alter the stress induced psychological disorders: A comparative study - PubMed,"              Stress has become an integral feature of everyday living. Each individual that lives encounters some manifestation of stress in life. Stress causes certain alterations in the structure and functions of the body and is considered to be a major factor in many health problems. Many synthetic and natural compounds are used for the attenuation of stress induced changes in the body. Medicinal plants are used since ancient times to prevent from neurological disorders. Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) is very efficacious and possesses the ability to improve several neurological disorders. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used against pain and inflammation. However, effectiveness of NSAIDs in the treatment of various psychiatric ailments is also reported. The present study investigated the effects of ibuprofen and lavender oil on stress induced behavioral and biochemical alterations in rats. The rats were subjected to restraint stress and behavioral parameters like open field test (OFT), light/dark transition box activity (LDT) and forced swim test (FST) were used to assess exploratory, anxiolytic and anti-depressant activity, respectively. Corticosterone, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and endogenous antioxidant enzymes activities were also estimated. Results of OFT, LDT and FST showed substantial effects of lavender oil and standard drug ibuprofen. A significant decrease in plasma corticosterone and LPO levels with increase in antioxidant enzyme activities was observed in the study. However, the effects of lavender oil were more as compared to standard drug ibuprofen in diminution of stress induced behavioral and biochemical changes in rats. This study demonstrates that lavender oil is more remedial than ibuprofen in stress related disorders.          "
lavender,"Expectancies, not aroma, explain impact of lavender aromatherapy on psychophysiological indices of relaxation in young healthy women - PubMed","        Objectives:                    In aromatherapy, lavender aroma is reputed to assist with relaxation. However, while there is much anecdotal evidence to that effect, the empirical literature is very inconsistent. Failure to employ adequate placebos, proper blinding, objective measures, or screening of prior beliefs about aromatherapy means that many previous findings could have been influenced by expectancy biases. The present study sought to establish whether lavender aroma and/or expectancies affect post-stress relaxation.                  Design:                    A double-blind, 3 (aroma) x 3 (instruction) x 10 (time in minutes) mixed-factorial placebo-controlled trial.                  Method:                    In a laboratory, 96 healthy undergraduate women were exposed to lavender, placebo, or no aroma during physiologically assessed relaxation after an arousing cognitive task. Where an aroma was presented, an instructional priming procedure was used to manipulate participants' expectancies about the aroma's likely impact on their ability to relax.                  Results:                    Results showed no effect of aroma on galvanic skin response during relaxation. However, the nature of instructional prime was associated with relaxation patterns: when expecting the aroma to inhibit them, participants relaxed more; when expecting facilitation, participants relaxed less. The effect was not seen with regard to self-reported relaxation (as represented by changes in state anxiety) and was independent of ratings of attitudes towards aromatherapy.                  Conclusions:                    The findings imply that the previous associations of lavender aroma with assisted relaxation may have been influenced by expectancy biases, and that the relevant expectancies are easily manipulable.

lavender,Aromatherapy and reducing preprocedural anxiety: A controlled prospective study - PubMed,"              The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of aromatherapy to reduce anxiety prior to a scheduled colonoscopy or esophagogastroduodenoscopy. A controlled, prospective study was done on a convenience sample of 118 patients. The ""state"" component of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to evaluate patients' anxiety levels pre- and postaromatherapy. The control group was given an inert oil (placebo) for inhalation, and the experimental group was given the essential oil, lavender, for inhalation. The STAI state anxiety raw score revealed that patients were at the 99th (women) and 96th (men) percentiles for anxiety. The intervention group and the control group had similar levels of state anxiety prior to the beginning of the study (t[116] = .47, p = .64). There was no difference in state anxiety levels between pre- and postplacebo inhalation in the control group (t[112] = .48, p = .63). There was no statistical difference in state anxiety levels between pre- and postlavender inhalation in the experimental group (t[120] = .73, p = .47). Although this study did not show aromatherapy to be effective based on statistical analysis, patients did generally report the lavender scent to be pleasant. Lavender is an inexpensive and popular technique for relaxation that can be offered to patients as an opportunity to promote preprocedural stress reduction in a hospital setting.          "
lavender,"Phase II trial on the effects of Silexan in patients with neurasthenia, post-traumatic stress disorder or somatization disorder - PubMed","              Silexan, a novel lavender oil preparation for oral use, has been authorized in Germany for the treatment of states of restlessness during anxious mood. An open-label, exploratory trial was performed to assess the potential of the medicinal product in the treatment of restlessness caused by anxiety as related to several disorders. Outcome measures included the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), von Zerssen's Depression Scale (D-S), the 36-item Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36), and a sleep diary. 50 male and female patients with neurasthenia (ICD-10 F48.0), post-traumatic stress disorder (PSD; F43.1), or somatization disorder (F45.0, F45.1) were included to receive 1 × 80 mg/day Silexan over 6 weeks; 47 could be analyzed for efficacy as full analysis set. At baseline, patients suffered from restlessness (96%), depressed mood (98%), sleep disturbances (92%), or anxiety (72%). Of those, resp. 62%, resp. 57%, resp.51%, resp. 62% showed improvements during treatment (p < 0.001). For all patients, mean D-S score decreased by 32.7% and SCL-90-R Global Severity Index by 36.4% as compared to baseline, (p < 0.001), while the SF-36 Mental Health Score increased by 48.2% (p < 0.001). Waking-up frequency (p = 0.002), Waking-up duration (p < 0.001) and morning tiredness (p = 0.005) were reduced, while efficiency of sleep (p = 0.018) and mood (p = 0.03) improved. Patients suffering from neurasthenia or PSD showed comparable improvements with most outcomes. The results in this trial justify to further investigate Silexan in disorders with accompanying restlessness caused by sub-threshold anxiety. Adverse reactions, predominantly gastrointestinal complaints, were judged as mild or moderate.          "
lavender,A study of neurocognition in bulimia nervosa and eating disorder not otherwise specified-bulimia type - PubMed,"              Neurocognition in bulimia nervosa (BN) is under-researched. This study investigated aspects of attention (d2-Letter Cancellation Task), inhibitory control (Stroop and go/no-go task), and decision making (Game of Dice Task) in 40 people with BN, 30 with eating disorder not otherwise specified-BN type (EDNOS-BN), and 65 healthy controls (HCs). The National Adult Reading Test (NART) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) were also administered. Analyses of covariance (covariates: age, NART, and DASS-21) showed that people with BN and EDNOS-BN performed as well as HCs on all tasks. Attention task performance was poorer in the EDNOS-BN than in the BN group.          "
lavender,Neuroprotective and Anti-Aging Potentials of Essential Oils from Aromatic and Medicinal Plants - PubMed,"              The use of essential oils (EOs) and their components is known since long in traditional medicine and aromatherapy for the management of various diseases, and is further increased in the recent times. The neuroprotective and anti-aging potentials of EOs and their possible mechanism of actions were evaluated by numerous researchers around the globe. Several clinically important EOs and their components from Nigella sativa, Acorus gramineus, Lavandula angustifolia, Eucalyptus globulus, Mentha piperita, Rosmarinus officinalis, Jasminum sambac, Piper nigrum and so many other plants are reported for neuroprotective effects. This review article was aimed to summarize the current finding on EOs tested against neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer disease (AD) and dementia. The effects of EOs on pathological targets of AD and dementia including amyloid deposition (Aβ), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), cholinergic hypofunction, oxidative stress and glutamatergic abnormalities were focused. Furthermore, effects of EOs on other neurological disorders including anxiety, depression, cognitive hypofunction epilepsy and convulsions were also evaluated in detail. In conclusion, EOs were effective on several pathological targets and have improved cognitive performance in animal models and human subjects. Thus, EOs can be developed as multi-potent agents against neurological disorders with better efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness.          "
lavender,Two representatives of lamiaceae essential oils and their main components cause changes in glutathione related enzymatic activities - PubMed,"Lavandula angustifolia Mill. (lavender) and Origanum heracleoticum L. (greek oregano) are aromatic plants used in traditional medicine for relief of convulsion, anxiety, insomnia and in the treatment of neurological disorders. On the basis of literature, we evaluated the changing in glutathione enzymatic activities provoked by the essential oils and pure components, linalool, carvacrol and limonene to study the mechanisms of action, responsible for several activities. Activities of SOD (superoxide dismutase) and GPx (glutathione peroxidase) tend to increase respect to control. SOD maximal increase reached up to 117% for carvacrol and limonene. Increase in GPx activity reached even up to value 1.229 for origanum oil in comparison to control 0.125 μkat/mg prot. Activities of GR (glutathione reductase), except for lavender, showed a biphasic response. Like for GR, the administration of compounds, resulted in a biphasic response in GST (glutathione-S-transferase) activities (with a consistent increase in activity at concentration 125 μg/mL for all compounds except lavender). Moreover, the changes in GSH (reduced glutathione), are no significant for different concentrations of essential oils. So, the biological properties of essential oils and specifically, the antioxidant ones, can be related to their capacity to modify the glutathione enzymatic activities.          "
lavender,Effects of lavender oil inhalation on improving scopolamine-induced spatial memory impairment in laboratory rats - PubMed,"              Lavender is reported to be an effective medical plant in treating inflammation, depression, stress and mild anxiety in Europe and the USA. The present study investigated the effects of two different lavender essential oils from Lavandula angustifolia ssp. angustifolia Mill. (Lamiaceae) and Lavandula hybrida Rev. (Lamiaceae) on neurological capacity of male Wistar rats subjected to scopolamine (0.7mg/kg)-induced dementia rat model. Chronic exposures to lavender essential oils (daily, for 7 continuous days) significantly reduced anxiety-like behavior and inhibited depression in elevated plus-maze and forced swimming tests, suggesting anxiolytic and antidepressant activity. Also, spatial memory performance in Y-maze and radial arm-maze tasks was improved, suggesting positive effects on memory formation. Taken together, multiple exposures to lavender essential oils could effectively reverse spatial memory deficits induced by dysfunction of the cholinergic system in the rat brain and might provide an opportunity for management neurological abnormalities in dementia conditions.

lavender,The association between psychological factors and breastfeeding behaviour in women with a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg m -2 : a systematic review - PubMed,"              Breastfeeding can play a key role in the reduction of obesity, but initiation and maintenance rates in women with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥30 kg m-2 are low. Psychological factors influence breastfeeding behaviours in the general population, but their role is not yet understood in women with a BMI ≥30 kg m-2 . Therefore, this review aimed to systematically search and synthesize the literature, which has investigated the association between any psychological factor and breastfeeding behaviour in women with a BMI ≥30 kg m-2 . The search identified 20 eligible papers, reporting 16 psychological factors. Five psychological factors were associated with breastfeeding behaviours: intentions to breastfeed, belief in breast milk's nutritional adequacy and sufficiency, belief about other's infant feeding preferences, body image and social knowledge. It is therefore recommended that current care should encourage women to plan to breastfeed, provide corrective information for particular beliefs and address their body image and social knowledge. Recommendations for future research include further exploration of several psychological factors (i.e. expecting that breastfeeding will enhance weight loss, depression, anxiety and stress) and evidence and theory-based intervention development.

lavender,Lemon oil vapor causes an anti-stress effect via modulating the 5-HT and DA activities in mice - PubMed,"              We examined the anti-stress action of the essential oils of lavender, rose, and lemon using an elevated plus-maze task (EPM), a forced swimming task (FST), and an open field task (OFT) in mice. Lemon oil had the strongest anti-stress effect in all three behavioral tasks. We further investigated a regulatory mechanism of the lemon oil by pre-treatments with agonists or antagonists to benzodiazepine, 5-HT, DA, and adrenaline receptors by the EPM and the FST. The anti-stress effect of lemon oil was significantly blocked by pre-treatment with frumazenil, benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, or apomorphine, a nonselective DA receptor agonist. In contrast, agonists or antagonists to the 5-HT receptor and the alpha-2 adrenaline receptor did not affect the anti-stress effect of lemon oil. Buspirone, DOI, and mianserine blocked the antidepressant-like effect of lemon oil in the FST, but WAY100,635 did not. These findings suggest that the antidepressant-like effect of lemon oil is closely related with the 5-HTnergic pathway, especially via 5-HT(1A) receptor. Moreover, the lemon oil significantly accelerated the metabolic turnover of DA in the hippocampus and of 5-HT in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. These results suggest that lemon oil possesses anxiolytic, antidepressant-like effects via the suppression of DA activity related to enhanced 5-HTnergic neurons.          "
lavender,Effects of aromatherapy on sleep quality and anxiety of patients - PubMed,"        Background:                    In intensive care units (ICUs), patients cannot sleep well. Aromatherapy is used for depression, anxiety, relaxation and disorders related with sleep and stress.                  Aim:                    This study aimed to investigate the effect of lavender essential oil on the sleep quality and anxiety level of patients in coronary ICU.                  Participants:                    A total of 60 patients in coronary ICU participated in this study.                  Design:                    A randomized controlled study was conducted with 60 patients in a province located in the southeast of Turkey.                  Methods:                    After informing the patients in both groups about the study, they were administered a questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scale. The patients in the intervention group were given 2% lavender essential oil via inhalation for 15 days after which they were administered the same scales again to evaluate the sleep quality and anxiety. As for the control group, they were administered the same scales again after 15 days without the inhalation of lavender essential oil.                  Results:                    Comparison of the PSQI and BAI scores of the patients in the control and intervention groups before and after the intervention showed statistically significant differences in the change in favour of the intervention group (p < 0·05).                  Conclusion:                    Lavender essential oil increased quality of sleep and reduced level of anxiety in patients with coronary artery disease.                  Relevance to clinical practice:                    As a non-invasive, cheap, easily applicable, cost-effective, independent nursing intervention and appropriate for cardiac patients, lavender essential oil could be applied in ICUs.

lavender,Effect of lavender essence inhalation on the level of anxiety and blood cortisol in candidates for open-heart surgery - PubMed,"        Background:                    Surgery, as a treatment, is a stressful experience. The anxiety is more severe in open-heart surgery patients due to its risk and complications. The present study aimed to determine the effect of lavender essence on the levels of anxiety and blood cortisol in candidates for open-heart surgery.                  Materials and methods:                    This was a single-blind clinical trial, a random allocation study with a control group conducted on 90 candidates for open-heart surgery in two groups of study and control. The study and control groups inhaled two drops of lavender and distilled water for 20 min, respectively. Spielberger questionnaire was filled by the patients. A 2 ml blood sample was taken to measure the cortisol level and patients' vital signs were recorded before and after intervention. Data were analyzed by chi-square in the form of mean, SD, and frequency distribution, independent t-test, paired t-test, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with a significance level of P = 0.05 to modify the pre-test scores.                  Results:                    Results showed a significant reduction in mean anxiety score from 56.73 (5.67) to 54.73 (5.42) after intervention in the study group, compared to the control group [1.11 (1.17)] (P < 0.001). There was also a higher difference in cortisol level in the study group compared to the control group [1.88 (0.56) vs. 0.42 (0.45)]. ANCOVA test showed that the 10.8% variance in anxiety score and 69.6% decrease in blood cortisol resulted from inhalation of lavender.                  Conclusions:                    Results showed the positive effect of lavender essence on anxiety and blood cortisol level among the patients. Aromatherapy with lavender is suggested to be considered as a nursing intervention in clinical settings.          "
lavender,Broken Heart Syndrome: A Typical Case - PubMed,"              This case describes a combination external treatment for ""Broken Heart Syndrome"" that includes a lavender footbath, massage using moor extract, and oxalis ointment to the abdomen applied by an Anthroposophic nurse for a specific personality type. Lavender footbaths have been used since ancient times for relaxation and calming, while moor extract has been used medicinally in Europe since the middle ages for warmth and environmental protection. Rhythmical massage using moor extract and oxalis ointment poultice to the abdomen are part of the tradition of Anthroposophic nursing when managing stress induced by emotional and physical trauma. An elderly lady with specific characteristics diagnosed as Broken Heart Syndrome received one treatment a week for 4 weeks given by an Anthroposophic nurse at an integrative medical center. Between treatments, education was given to enable self-treatment in the home. The nursing treatments, each using lavender footbaths, moor extract massage, and oxalis ointment poultice to the abdomen, proved very effect, and no negative effects were reported. External applications need to be considered by nurses caring for specific personality types with Broken Heart Syndrome.           "
lavender,Lavender Oil Reduces Depressive Mood in Healthy Individuals and Enhances the Activity of Single Oxytocin Neurons of the Hypothalamus Isolated from Mice: A Preliminary Study - PubMed,"        Background:                    The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of lavender oil inhalation on blood pressure, pulse measurements, cortisol levels, depressive mood, and anxiety in healthy male adults. The mechanism was investigated by the action on oxytocin single neurons in the hypothalamus of rodents.                  Methods:                    The participants (n = 7) were aged 20-40 years. After randomisation, they received an inhaled dose of lavender oil or distilled water for 20 min. They received the other treatment after a washout period of one week. We assessed the outcomes using the Self-Rating Depression Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and self-rated unidimensional Visual Analogue Scale for depression; anxiety; and hunger, thirst, and appetite, respectively. Blood pressure, pulse rate, and cortisol concentration in the peripheral blood were assessed before and after inhalation. In the rodent study (n = 4), oxytocin single neurons were isolated from the mouse hypothalamus. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration in the oxytocin neurons isolated from the hypothalamus was measured following direct administration of lavender oil.                  Results:                    Seven participants completed the study. Lavender inhalation decreased Self-Rating Depression Scale score and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Ex vivo administration of lavender oil increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration in the hypothalamic oxytocin neurons.                  Conclusions:                    Lavender oil might be a useful therapy for stress relief, and its mechanism of action may include activation of the central oxytocin neurons.          "
lavender,Exploring the relationship between facets of mindfulness and eating pathology in women - PubMed,"              Although researchers have examined the efficacy of acceptance- and mindfulness-based interventions in the treatment of eating disorders, few studies have explored the association between trait mindfulness and eating pathology. Therefore, the purpose of the current investigation was to examine the unique associations between multiple facets of mindfulness (acting with awareness, nonreactivity, nonjudgment, describing, and observing) and eating pathology. Undergraduate women (N = 276) completed the Eating Attitudes Test-26, the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, and the 21-item version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales. A hierarchical regression analysis revealed that four mindfulness facets (awareness, nonreactivity, nonjudgment, and describing) were uniquely associated with eating pathology above and beyond anxiety and depression symptoms. Results are discussed with regard to the potential role of various facets of trait mindfulness in eating pathology as well as the possible utility of mindfulness-based treatments for eating disorders.

lavender,A randomized controlled trial of aromatherapy massage in a hospice setting - PubMed,"              Research suggests that patients with cancer, particularly in the palliative care setting, are increasingly using aromatherapy and massage. There is good evidence that these therapies may be helpful for anxiety reduction for short periods, but few studies have looked at the longer term effects. This study was designed to compare the effects of four-week courses of aromatherapy massage and massage alone on physical and psychological symptoms in patients with advanced cancer. Forty-two patients were randomly allocated to receive weekly massages with lavender essential oil and an inert carrier oil (aromatherapy group), an inert carrier oil only (massage group) or no intervention. Outcome measures included a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of pain intensity, the Verran and Snyder-Halpern (VSH) sleep scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale and the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL). We were unable to demonstrate any significant long-term benefits of aromatherapy or massage in terms of improving pain control, anxiety or quality of life. However, sleep scores improved significantly in both the massage and the combined massage (aromatherapy and massage) groups. There were also statistically significant reductions in depression scores in the massage group. In this study of patients with advanced cancer, the addition of lavender essential oil did not appear to increase the beneficial effects of massage. Our results do suggest, however, that patients with high levels of psychological distress respond best to these therapies.          "
lavender,[The effects of the inhalation method using essential oils on blood pressure and stress responses of clients with essential hypertension] - PubMed,"        Purpose:                    The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of aromatherapy on blood pressure and stress responses of clients with essential hypertension.                  Method:                    There were fifty-two subjects divided into an essential oil group, placebo group, and control group by random assignment. The application of aromatherapy was the inhalation method of blending oils with lavender, ylangylang, and bergamot once daily for 4 weeks. To evaluate the effects of aromatherapy, blood pressure and pulse were measured two times a week and serum cortisol levels, catecholamine levels, subjective stress, and state anxiety were measured before and after treatment in the three groups. Data was analyzed by repeated measures of ANOVA, one-way ANOVA, and chi(2)-test using the SPSS 10.0 program.                  Results:                    The blood pressure, pulse, subjective stress, state anxiety, and serum cortisol levels among the three groups were significantly statistically different. The differences of catecholamine among the three groups were not significant statistically.                  Conclusion:                    The results suggest that the inhalation method using essential oils can be considered an effective nursing intervention that reduces psychological stress responses and serum cortisol levels, as well as the blood pressure of clients with essential hypertension.

lavender,Effects of inhaled lavender essential oil on stress-loaded animals: changes in anxiety-related behavior and expression levels of selected mRNAs and proteins - PubMed,"              Inhalation of various essential oils elicits behavioral changes as a consequence of a complex centrally coordinated response. To understand the molecular mechanisms of action of aromatic compounds on emotional responses, we evaluated the stress-induced changes in mouse brain and the efficacy of inhaled essential oil from Lavandula officinalis (LvEO) using two approaches: a behavioral test, and examining the expression levels of selected genes {fast nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) mRNA, activity regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc) mRNA} and proteins {galactokinase 1 (GLK1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)}. Animals were randomly divided into 4 groups depending on the treatment given: stress (-)/H20, stress (-)/LvEO, stress (+)/H2O, and stress (+)/LvEO group. For behavioral testing, using an elevated plus-maze test, significant anxiolytic-like effects were seen in both the stress (-)/LVEO and stress (+)/LvEO groups, indicating that LvEO exerts anxiolytic-like effects regardless of the administration of water immersion stress. On expression analysis, the levels of NGFR and Arc mRNA were significantly lower in animals subjected to stress. Inhalation of LvEO, however, reversed this change, thus suggesting that LvEO negates the impact of stress on gene expression levels. Meanwhile, significant decreases in expression levels were also observed in the stress (-)/LvEO group, which implies that LvEO, when given in a stress-free situation, may act as a stress stimulus. Taken together, our data suggest that inhalation of LvEO exerts bidirectional influences in the central nervous system (CNS) of animals, either attenuating the effects of stress or acting as a stressor, depending on the subject state.

lavender,Lavender ( Lavandula angustifolia Mill.) Essential Oil Alleviates Neuropathic Pain in Mice With Spared Nerve Injury - PubMed,"              Low treatment efficacy represents an important unmet need in neuropathic pain patients and there is an urgent need to develop a more effective pharmacotherapy. An increasing number of patients choose complementary medicine to relieve pain. Lavender essential oil (LEO) is approved by the European Medicines Agency as herbal medicine to relieve anxiety and stress. However, the capability of LEO to relieve other nervous system disorders such as neuropathic pain has never been established. Our work aimed to evaluate the antineuropathic properties of lavender on a spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain in mice. An acute oral administration of LEO (100 mg/kg) alleviated SNI-induced mechanical allodynia, evaluated in the von Frey test, with an intensity comparable to the reference drug pregabalin. Investigations into the mechanism of action showed that LEO markedly decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1, ERK2, and JNK1, and decreased the levels of iNOS in the spinal cord; involvement of the endocannabinoid system was also detected using in vitro inhibition of the FAAH and MALG enzymes as well as in vivo experiments with the CB1 antagonist. Conversely, no effect on P38 phosphorylation and NF-kB activation was detected. These antihyperalgesic effects appeared at the same dose able to induce antidepressant-like, anxiolytic-like, and anorexic effects. In addition, gavage with LEO did not significantly alter animals' gross behavior, motor coordination, or locomotor activity, nor impaired memory functions. Oral administration of LEO could represent a therapeutic approach in the management of neuropathic pain states.          "
lavender,Is lavender an anxiolytic drug? A systematic review of randomised clinical trials - PubMed,"        Background:                    Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) is often recommended for stress/anxiety relief and believed to possess anxiolytic effects.                  Aim:                    To critically evaluate the efficacy/effectiveness of lavender for the reduction of stress/anxiety.                  Methods:                    Seven electronic databases were searched to identify all relevant studies. All methods of lavender administration were included. Data extraction and the assessment of the methodological quality of all included trials were conducted by two independent reviewers.                  Results:                    Fifteen RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Two trials scored 4 points on the 5-point Jadad scale, the remaining 13 scored two or less. Results from seven trials appeared to favour lavender over controls for at least one relevant outcome.                  Conclusion:                    Methodological issues limit the extent to which any conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy/effectiveness of lavender. The best evidence suggests that oral lavender supplements may have some therapeutic effects. However, further independent replications are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.          "
lavender,"Effect of lavender scent inhalation on prevention of stress, anxiety and depression in the postpartum period - PubMed","        Background:                    Stress, anxiety, and postpartum depression are the most common problems among women in their childbearing age. Research has shown that aromatherapy administered during labor reduces anxiety in mothers. With regard to the specific biological conditions in postpartum period and the subsequent drop in hormone levels, this study investigated the effect of lavender on prevention of stress, anxiety, and postpartum depression in women.                  Materials and methods:                    In a clinical trial, 140 women admitted to the obstetric and gynecological unit were randomly divided into aromatherapy and non-aromatherapy groups immediately after delivery. Intervention with aromatherapy consisted of inhaling three drops of lavender essential oil every 8 h with for 4 weeks. The control group received routine care after discharge and was followed up by telephone only. After 2 weeks, 1 and 3 months of delivery, women were assessed by the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale and the Edinburgh stress, anxiety, and depression scale in the two groups. Data analysis was performed by Mann-Whitney, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and post hoc tests. Level of significance was set as 0.05 for all tests.                  Results:                    The results showed that the mean stress, anxiety, and depression at time point of 2 weeks (P = 0.012, P < 0.0001, and P = 0.003, respectively) and stress, anxiety, and depression scores at time points of 1 month (P < 0.0001) and 3 months after delivery (P < 0.0001) were significantly lower in the study group compared with the control group.                  Conclusions:                    Inhaling the scent of lavender for 4 weeks can prevent stress, anxiety, and depression after childbirth.          "
lavender,Beneficial effects of Silexan on sleep are mediated by its anxiolytic effect - PubMed,"              Disturbed sleep is among the most prevalent hyperarousal symptoms in anxiety disorders. Most drugs recommended for anxiety and insomnia have a sedating effect which is related to their beneficial effect on disturbed sleep. Silexan is a proprietary essential oil from Lavandula angustifolia. This drug has significant anxiolytic and sleep improving properties. Interestingly, these effects are not associated with sedation. Here we asked whether the positive effects on sleep are due to primary pharmacodynamic or secondary, disease related effects. We used the data from a double-blind, randomized study in which 212 patients were analyzed for efficacy after ten weeks' treatment with 80 mg/day Silexan or placebo. Anxiety and disturbed sleep were assessed using the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. Regression-based mediation analysis was employed to estimate direct treatment effects and indirect effects mediated by anxiety control separately for each study group. Sobel's test was used to investigate the extent to which the mediator (HAMA change) contributes to the total effect of the independent variable (treatment) on the dependent variable (PSQI change). Compared to placebo, Silexan significantly reduced the total scores of the HAMA (p < 0.001) and of the PSQI (p = 0.002) after ten weeks, with clinically meaningful treatment group differences that were observed already after two and six weeks for HAMA and PSQI, respectively. Silexan had a statistically meaningful indirect effect on sleep (mediated by the effect on anxiety; p < 0.001) but no appreciable direct effect (p = 0.958). The ratio between the indirect and the total effect was determined to be 0.984, i. e., 98.4% of the total effect of Silexan on disturbed sleep were explained by the effect of Silexan on the symptoms of anxiety whereas 1.6% were attributable to a direct effect. The results indicate that Silexan exerts a secondary sleep improving effect almost exclusively through its anxiolytic action rather than by sedation. Findings are consistent with the drug's assumed mechanism of action.          "
lavender,"Sensing an improvement: an experimental study to evaluate the use of aromatherapy, massage and periods of rest in an intensive care unit - PubMed","              There is widespread belief that the use of aromatherapy and massage in an intensive care environment offers a means of increasing the quality of sensory input that patients receive, as well as reducing levels of stress and anxiety. Despite a wealth of anecdotal evidence in support of these claims, there have been few objective studies to evaluate the effects of these therapies. In this experimental study 122 patients admitted to a general intensive care unit were randomly allocated to receive either massage, aromatherapy using essential oil of lavender, or a period of rest. Both pre- and post-therapy assessments included physiological stress indicators and patients' evaluation of their anxiety levels, mood and ability to cope with their intensive care experience. Ninety-three patients (77%) were able to complete subjective assessments. There were no statistically significant differences in the physiological stress indicators or observed or reported behaviour of patients' ability to cope following any of the three interventions. However, those patients who received aromatherapy reported significantly greater improvement in their mood and perceived levels of anxiety. They also felt less anxious and more positive immediately following the therapy, although this effect was not sustained or cumulative.          "

We aimed to evaluate the effect of Lavender cream with or without foot-bath on depression, anxiety and stress of pregnant women.                  Methods:                    In this trial, 141 women at 25 to 28 weeks gestation were randomly assigned into three groups (47 at each group); receiving Lavender cream with foot-bath, only Lavender cream, or placebo, 2g every night for two months. Depression, anxiety and stress were assessed at baseline, and 4(th) and 8(th) weeks after intervention, using DASS-21. General linear model was used to compare the groups.                  Results:                    There were three losses to follow-up at the 4(th) and one more at the 8(th) week. Scores of all three outcomes in both Lavender and foot-bath and only Lavender groups were significantly lower than those in the placebo group at the 8(th) week; adjusted difference of depression score -3.3, 95% confidence interval -4.6 to -1.9;-2.4, -3.7 to -1.0, respectively, anxiety score -1.4, -2.6 to -0.2; -1.7,-2.9 to -0.5 and stress score -3.1, -4.7 to -1.5; -2.7, -4.3 to -1.1. At the 4(th) week, only score of anxiety in the lavender group (-2.3, -3.9 to -0.8) and stress in the both groups (-2.3, -4.1 to -0.5; -1.9, -3.7 to -0.1) were significantly less than those in the placebo group. There were not statistically significant differences between the two experimental groups in terms of the outcomes.

lavender,Women's views of high risk pregnancy under threat of preterm birth - PubMed,"        Objective:                    To gain an understanding of the experiences of pregnant women at risk of having a preterm birth (PTB) who were attending a specialist preterm antenatal clinic and to elicit their views on treatment to prevent PTB.                  Study design:                    A qualitative interpretive approach was adopted, utilizing focus groups and one-to-one interviews. The semi-structured interview schedule focused on two main areas; risk and treatment for preterm birth. Fourteen pregnant women were recruited from a preterm antenatal clinic at a major tertiary referral centre in the North West of England. All interviews were audio recorded, with consent, and transcribed verbatim before carrying out thematic analysis.                  Results:                    Analysis revealed 3 main themes. Women struggled with 'balancing the risks' associated with the threat of preterm birth, they developed 'personal coping strategies to survive the pregnancy' and they watched as the strain made their 'whole family crumble'.                  Conclusion:                    Women's journey through pregnancy after a previous PTB experience is one of emotional and physical endurance. Women embrace the 'high risk' identity as it offers the opportunity for regular assessment and clinical reassurance. However, emotional and psychological needs must also be addressed to reduce stress and anxiety. By setting mutually agreed short term goals, significant milestones can be reached so that women feel they are successfully progressing through a high risk pregnancy through a series of 'baby steps'.

lavender,"Combined non-adaptive light and smell stimuli lowered blood pressure, reduced heart rate and reduced negative affect - PubMed","              Bright light therapy has been shown to have a positive impact on seasonal affective disorder (SAD), depression and anxiety. Smell has also has been shown to have effects on mood, stress, anxiety and depression. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the combination of light and smell in a non-adaptive cycle. Human subjects were given smell (lemon, lavender or peppermint) and light stimuli in a triangular wave (60scycle) for 15min. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored before and after each session for 5 consecutive days and a Profile of Mood States (POMS) test was administered before and after the sensory stimulation on days 1, 3 and 5. The light-smell stimulus lowered blood pressure, both systolic and diastolic, and reduced heart rate for all odours compared to control. Of the two sensory stimuli, the odour stimulus contributed most to this effect. The different aromas in the light-smell combinations could be distinguished by their different effects on the mood factors with lemon inducing the greatest mood changes in Dejection-Depression, Anger-Hostility, Tension-Anxiety. In conclusion, combined light and smell stimulation was effective in lowering blood pressure, reducing heart rate and improving mood. The combination was more effective than either smell or light stimuli alone, suggesting that a light-smell combination would be a more robust and efficacious alternative treatment for depression, anxiety and stress.

Methods:                    We conducted an electronic search of four authentic databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which compared inhalation aromatherapy versus control in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, were included. Data were extracted from eligible studies and pooled in a meta-analysis model. We sought to evaluate anxiety, pain, stress, and vital signs including heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure.                  Results:                    Nine RCTs were included in this study with a total of 656 patients. Our analysis showed inhalation aromatherapy was significantly effective in reducing anxiety (MD= -3.11, 95 % CI [-5.26, -0.96], p = 0.005), and pain (MD= -0.83, 95 % CI [-1.59, -0.07], p = 0.03) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Additionally, inhalation aromatherapy significantly reduced heart rate compared to control group (MD= -5.49, 95 % CI [-9.07, -1.81], p = 0.003). However, no significant differences were found between both groups in mental stress, systolic and diastolic blood pressure.                  Conclusion:                    Inhalation aromatherapy administration especially with lavender can significantly reduce anxiety, pain, and heart rate in patients performed cardiac surgery. However, it is not associated with significant differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Further studies are needed to confirm our results.          "
lavender,Lavandula angustifolia Essential Oil and Linalool Counteract Social Aversion Induced by Social Defeat - PubMed,"              Many vegetable extracts, essential oils, and their main constituents are active on the Central Nervous System (CNS). In fact, they have been used as sedatives, hypnotics, or tranquilizers for their activity in treating CNS disorders. In this research, we studied the possible activities of Lavandula angustifolia (LA) essential oil and of its main constituent, linalool, as anti-stress compounds on anxiety and social interaction and their in vitro effects on proteins (pERK and PKA) involved in the transmission of the signal. An acute intraperitoneal injection of linalool (100 mg/kg) and of LA essential oil (200 mg/kg) reduced motor activity without any anxiolytic effect, but significantly increased social interaction. Stressed mice, after being exposed to a social defeat encounter, showed heightened anxiety and social avoidance. Acute administration of LA essential oil blocked stress-induced anxiety, while linalool showed no effects. However, both compounds were capable of reversing social aversion, acting as antidepressant agents. Our results showed that linalool inhibits pERK and PKA expression in the SH-SY5Y cell, but no effect was detected with the LA essential oil. Therefore, the LA essential oil and linalool may be considered as useful alternative tools to the available traditional treatments for social stress-induced mental illnesses.          "
lavender,Aromatherapy as an adjuvant treatment in cancer care--a descriptive systematic review - PubMed,"              Claims of benefits of aromatherapy for cancer patients include reduced anxiety levels and relief of emotional stress, pain, muscular tension and fatigue. The objective of this paper is to provide an updated descriptive, systematic review of evidence from pre-clinical and clinical trials assessing the benefits and safety of aromatherapy for cancer patients. Literature databases such as Medline (via Ovid), the Cochrane database of systematic reviews, Cochrane Central were searched from their inception until October 2010. Only studies on cancer cells or cancer patients were included. There is no long lasting effect of aromatherapy massage, while short term improvements were reported for general well being, anxiety and depression up to 8 weeks after treatment. The reviewed studies indicate short-term effects of aromatherapy on depression, anxiety and overall wellbeing. Specifically, some clinical trials found an increase in patient-identified symptom relief, psychological wellbeing and improved sleep. Furthermore, some found a short-term improvement (up to 2 weeks after treatment) in anxiety and depression scores and better pain control. Although essential oils have generally shown minimal adverse effects, potential risks include ingesting large amounts (intentional misuse); local skin irritation, especially with prolonged skin contact; allergic contact dermatitis; and phototoxicity from reaction to sunlight (some oils). Repeated topical administration of lavender and tea tree oil was associated with reversible prepubertal gynecomastia.           "
holy basil,Novel Ocimumoside A and B as anti-stress agents: modulation of brain monoamines and antioxidant systems in chronic unpredictable stress model in rats - PubMed,"              Therapies targeting central stress mechanisms are fundamental for the development of successful treatment strategies. Ocimum sanctum (OS) is an Indian medicinal plant traditionally used for the treatment of various stress-related conditions. Previously, we have isolated and characterized three OS compounds; Ocimarin, Ocimumoside A and Ocimumoside B. However, their role in modulating chronic stress-induced central changes is unexplored. Thus, in the present study the efficacy of these OS compounds have been evaluated on the chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced alterations in the monoaminergic and antioxidant systems in the frontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus, along with the changes in the plasma corticosterone levels. CUS (two different types of stressors daily for seven days) resulted in a significant elevation of plasma corticosterone level, which was reversed to control levels by pretreatment with Ocimumoside A and B (40 mg/kg p.o.), while Ocimarin showed no effect. The levels of NA, DA and 5-HT were significantly decreased in all the three brain regions by CUS, with a selective increase of DA metabolites. A significant decrease in the glutathione (GSH) content, the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase with a significant increase in the glutathione peroxidase activity and lipid peroxidation was observed in all the three regions of the brain by CUS. The OS compounds alone did not cause any significant change in the baseline values of these parameters. However, Ocimumoside A and B (40 mg/kg body p.o.) attenuated these CUS-induced alterations with an efficacy similar to that of standard anti-stress (Panax quinquefolium; 100 mg/kg p.o.) and antioxidant (Melatonin; 20 mg/kg i.p.) drugs. While, Ocimarin failed to modulate these CUS-induced alterations. Therefore, this is the first report which identified the anti-stress activity of novel Ocimumoside A and B at the level of central monoamines and antioxidant properties, implicating their therapeutic importance in the prevention of stress-related disorders.

holy basil,Holy basil (Ocimum sanctum Linn.) leaf extract enhances specific cognitive parameters in healthy adult volunteers: A placebo controlled study - PubMed,"        Introduction:                    Ocimum sanctum (OS), known as Holy basil, has been documented to possess neuroprotective, cognition-enhancing and stress relieving effects in animal models. However there is paucity of clinical studies to document these effects.                  Materials and methods:                    Effect of OS on parameters related to cognition and stress in humans was evaluated with administration of 300 milligram capsules of ethanolic leaf extracts of Ocimum sanctum (EtOS) or placebo per day, over 30 days.                  Results:                    Intra-group comparison of Sternberg and Stroop test showed improvement in both the placebo and EtOS groups, however, the improvement stabilized after day 15 in the placebo group. Intergroup comparison revealed a significant improvement of the following cognitive parameters in the EtOS as compared to the placebo: reaction time (RT) and error rate (ER) of Sternberg test, RT of neutral task of Stroop, RT and ER of interference task of Stroop. The intra-group comparison of P300 latency, salivary cortisol, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory showed improvement over time in the EtOS group alone, though the inter-group difference was significant in the P300 latency alone. There were no changes in heart rate (HR), AHR, or galvanic skin response (GSR) or AGSR.                  Conclusion:                    Ocimum sanctum leaf extract seems to have potential cognition-enhancing properties in humans.          "
holy basil,Controlled programmed trial of Ocimum sanctum leaf on generalized anxiety disorders - PubMed,"              Ocimumn sanctum, an Indian medicinal plant, has been on trial for its role in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in hospital based clinical set-up. Hamilton's brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) and thorough clinical investigations were used to screen the subjects. Thirty-five subjects (21 male and 14 female; average age 38.4 years) were medicated with the plant extract in a fixed dose regime (500 mg/capsule, twice daily, p.o. after meal). They were thoroughly investigated clinically and using standard questionnaires based on different psychological rating scale at baseline (day 0), mid-term (day 30) and final (day 60). The observations exhibited that, O. sanctum significantly (p<0.001) attenuated generalized anxiety disorders and also attenuated its correlated stress and depression. It further significantly (p<0.001) improved the willingness to adjustment and attention in human. Therefore, it may be concluded that O. sanctum may be useful in the treatment of GAD in human and may be a promising anxiolytic agent in near future.          "
holy basil,Effects of Ocimum sanctum and Camellia sinensis on stress-induced anxiety and depression in male albino Rattus norvegicus - PubMed,"        Objective:                    The aim of this study was to study the ameliorative effects of Ocimum sanctum and Camellia sinensis on stress-induced anxiety and depression.                  Materials and methods:                    The study was carried out using male albino rats (200 ± 50 g). The effect of O. sanctum and C. sinensis was evaluated for anxiety and depression using elevated plus maze (EPM) test, open field test (OFT), forced swim test (FST), and tail suspension test (TST).                  Result:                    Restraint stress (3 h/day for six consecutive days) induced a significant reduction in both the percentage number of entries and time spent in open arms in EPM, and these changes were reversed with post-treatment of aqueous extract of O. sanctum and C. sinensis (100 mg/kg for 6 days). Restraint stress-induced (a) increased latency and (b) decreased ambulation and rearing were also reversed by O. sanctum and C. sinensis in OFT. A significant increase in immobility period was observed in FST and TST after restraint stress. O. sanctum and C. sinensis significantly reduced the immobility times of rats in FST and TST.                  Conclusion:                    O. sanctum and C. sinensis possess anxiolytic and antidepressant activities.          "
holy basil,Efficacy of Ocimum sanctum for relieving stress: a preclinical study - PubMed,"              HISTORY AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to study the anxiolytic effects of Ocimum sanctum stress-induced anxiety.                  Materials and methods:                    The study was carried out using male albino rats (200 ± 50 gm), male albino mice (25 ± 100) the effect of O. sanctum evaluated for anxiety and depression using forced swim test FST and rotarod test.                  Results:                    Restraint stress (3 hours/day for six consecutive days) induced a significant reduction. It was significantly decreases the mobility period during stress. The standard deviation values are 14.4 and 9.26 and is statistically significant (p = 0.001). In rotarod test, (a) increased latency and (b) decreased ambulation and rearing were also reversed by O. sanctum. A significant increase in immobility period was observed in FST and TST after restraint stress. O. sanctum and C. sinensis significantly reduced the immobility times of rats in FST and TST.                  Conclusion:                    Ocimum sanctum possess significant antistress activity but the magnitude and efficacy for relieving stress is less, when compare to standard anxiolytic agent, i.e. Alprazolam.

holy basil,Evaluation of anti-amnesic effect of extracts of selected Ocimum species using in-vitro and in-vivo models - PubMed,"        Ethnopharmacological relevance:                    Ocimum species are traditionally used for the treatment of anxiety, nerve pain, convulsions and a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the anti-amnesic effect of O. basilicum L., O. sanctum L. and O. gratissimum L. extracts using in-vitro and in-vivo models.                  Materials and methods:                    In-vitro acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory and antioxidant activities of hydro-methanol extracts of plants were evaluated using Ellman and DPPH and FRAP assays, respectively. The most active extract i.e. O. basilicum extract (OBE) was further explored for the possible anti-amnesic activity in mouse model of scopolamine induced amnesia using behavioral models (elevated plus maze and passive shock avoidance task). Brain AChE activity, oxidative profile and histopathological studies were assessed to outline the anti-amnesic mechanism of the extract.                  Results:                    Significant antioxidant and AChE inhibition activity was observed with all prepared extracts and however, OBE showed most marked free radical scavenging, reducing power and AChE inhibition (IC50 0.65±0.15mg/ml) activity. Basil leaves were standardized with respect to content of 7 phenolic acids using a HPLC-PDA method. A TLC densitometric method was employed to determine the quercetin content in the leaves. The in-vivo studies showed that OBE pre-treatment (200 and 400mg/kg, p.o.) reversed the memory deficit induced by scopolamine in mice, evident by significant (p<0.05) decrease in the transfer latency time and increase in step down latency in elevated plus maze and passive shock avoidance task, respectively. Moreover, OBE significantly reduced the brain AChE activity and oxidative stress. Further, histopathological examination of brain tissues displayed decrease in vacuolated cytoplasm and increase in pyramidal cells in hippocampal and cortical regions with OBE pre-treatment.                  Conclusion:                    OBE possesses antioxidant and AChE inhibitory activity. These biochemical changes are responsible for the anti-amnesic and neuroprotective activities of O. basilicum which may be attributed to the presence of phenolic and flavonoid compounds. This can be developed as an effective anti-amnesic drug.          "
turmeric,GABAergic and nitriergic modulation by curcumin for its antianxiety-like activity in mice - PubMed,"              In the present study, effect of curcumin (10 and 20mg/kg), an active constituent of Curcuma longa was evaluated for its antianxiety-like activity in mice subjected to immobilization-induced restraint stress for 6h. The effect on anxiety was assessed by employing elevated plus maze, open field test, light/dark test and social interaction test. Only the higher dose (20mg/kg, i.p.) of curcumin produced significant antianxiety-like effect in stressed mice. Pre-treatment with aminoguanidine (50mg/kg; i.p.), an inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor significantly enhanced the anxiolytic-like effect of curcumin in stressed mice as compared to curcumin and aminoguanidine per se in stressed mice. Pretreatment with 7-nitroindazole (20mg/kg), a neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor did not significantly affect the antianxiety-like response of curcumin in stressed mice as compared to curcumin per se. Restraint stress significantly increased plasma nitrite levels in mice. Curcumin (20mg/kg, i.p.) and aminoguanidine significantly decreased plasma nitrite levels in stressed mice. The combination of aminoguanidine and curcumin significantly decreased the plasma nitrite levels as compared to curcumin and aminoguanidine per se in stressed mice. Curcumin and aminoguanidine did not produce any significant change in brain GABA contents of the animals. Diazepam (2mg/kg) produced significant anxiolytic-like effect only in unstressed mice, but could not exert significant anxiolysis in stressed mice. However, diazepam significantly increased GABA contents in both unstressed and stressed mice as compared to respective control groups. These findings suggest the possible involvement of only inducible NOS and not neuronal NOS in antianxiety-like effect of curcumin.          "
turmeric,The effect of curcumin on the brain-gut axis in rat model of irritable bowel syndrome: involvement of 5-HT-dependent signaling - PubMed,"              Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is induced by dysfunction of central nervous and peripheral intestinal systems, which affects an estimated 10-15% population worldwide annually. Stress-related psychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety are often comorbid with gastrointestinal function disorder, such as IBS. However, the mechanism of IBS still remains unknown. Curcumin is a biologically active phytochemical presents in turmeric and has pharmacological actions that benefit patients with depression and anxiety. Our study found that IBS rats showed depression- and anxiety-like behaviors associated with decreased 5-HT (serotonin), BDNF (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and pCREB (phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein) expression in the hippocampus after chronic acute combining stress (CAS). However, these decreased parameters were obviously increased in the colonic after CAS. Curcumin (40 mg/kg) reduced the immobility time of forced swimming and the number of buried marbles in behavioral tests of CAS rats. Curcumin also decreased the number of fecal output and abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores in response to graded distention. Moreover, curcumin increased serotonin, BDNF and pCREB levels in the hippocampus, but they were decreased in the colonic of CAS rats. 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist NAN-190 reversed the effects of curcumin on behaviors and the changes of intestine, pCREB and BDNF expression, which are related to IBS. These results suggested that curcumin exerts the effects on IBS through regulating neurotransmitters, BDNF and CREB signaling both in the brain and peripheral intestinal system.          "
turmeric,Curcumin Alters Neural Plasticity and Viability of Intact Hippocampal Circuits and Attenuates Behavioral Despair and COX-2 Expression in Chronically Stressed Rats - PubMed,"              Curcumin is a major diarylheptanoid component of Curcuma longa with traditional usage for anxiety and depression. It has been known for the anti-inflammatory, antistress, and neurotropic effects. Here we examined curcumin effect in neural plasticity and cell viability. 60-channel multielectrode array was applied on organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) to monitor the effect of 10 μM curcumin in long-term depression (LTD) through low-frequency stimulation (LFS) to the Schaffer collaterals and commissural pathways. Cell viability was assayed by propidium iodide uptake test in OHSCs. In addition, the influence of oral curcumin administration on rat behavior was assessed with the forced swim test (FST). Finally, protein expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were measured by Western blot in chronically stressed rats. Our results demonstrated that 10 μM curcumin attenuated LTD and reduced cell death. It also recovered the behavior immobility of FST, rescued the attenuated BDNF expression, and inhibited the enhancement of COX-2 expression in stressed animals. These findings indicate that curcumin can enhance postsynaptic electrical reactivity and cell viability in intact neural circuits with antidepressant-like effects, possibly through the upregulation of BDNF and reduction of inflammatory factors in the brain.

turmeric,Systemic Administration of Curcumin Affect Anxiety-Related Behaviors in a Rat Model of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder via Activation of Serotonergic Systems - PubMed,"              Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a trauma-induced psychiatric disease characterized by impaired hyperarousal, fear extermination, depression, anxiety, and amnesic symptoms that may include the release of monoamines in the dread circuit. Curcumin (CUR), a major diarylheptanoid and polyphenolic component of Curcuma longa, reportedly possesses several pharmacological features, including antidiabetic, antiatherosclerotic, anticancer, and neuropsychiatric actions. But the anxiolytic-like effects of CUR and its mechanism of action in PTSD are unclear. The current research measured some anxiety-related behavioral responses to examine the effects of CUR on symptoms of anxiety in rats after single prolonged stress (SPS) exposure by reversing the serotonin (5-HT) dysfunction. Rats received CUR (20, 50, or 100 mg/kg, i.p., once daily) for 14 days after SPS exposure. Administration of CUR significantly increased the number of central zone crossings in the open field test and reduced grooming behavior in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test and increased the number of open-arm visits on the EPM test. CUR administration significantly reduced freezing response to contextual fear conditioning. CUR recovered neurochemical abnormalities and SPS-induced decreased 5-HT tissue levels in the hippocampus, amygdala, and striatum. These results suggested that CUR has anxiolytic-like effects on biochemical and behavioral symptoms associated with anxiety. Thus, CUR may be a useful agent to alleviate or treat psychiatric disorders similar to those observed in patients with PTSD.          "
turmeric,The authenticity and quality of Rhodiola rosea products - PubMed,"        Background:                    Rhodiola rosea L. Crassulaceae, root (Golden Root, Arctic Root) is a high-value herbal medicinal product, registered in the UK for the treatment of stress-induced fatigue, exhaustion and anxiety based on traditional use and used throughout Europe as a herbal medicinal product for similar indications. Numerous unregistered supplements are also available. There are several Chinese species used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), including Rhodiola crenulata (Hook.f. & Thomoson) that is believed to be a common adulterant in the R. rosea value chain.                  Aims:                    The project is embedded in a larger study aiming to investigate the diverse value chains that lead to the production of R. rosea as an herbal medicinal product or supplement. Here we focus on a comparison of the quality of the finished products and assess any phytochemical variation between products registered under the Traditional Herbal Medicine Products Directive (THMPD) and products obtained from the market without any registration (i.e. generally unlicensed supplements). Our key aim is to establish the extent of the problem in terms of adulteration of consumer products claiming to contain R. rosea (or R. crenulata).                  Methods:                    Approximately 40 commercial products (granulated powders and extracts) were sourced from different suppliers. We analysed these samples using high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC), mass spectrometry (MS) and (1)H NMR spectroscopy coupled with multi-variate analysis software following a method previously developed by our group for the analysis of turmeric products.                  Results:                    We investigate the phytochemistry of the different species and assess the potential of R. crenulata as an adulterant at the end of the R. rosea value chains. The consistency of the products varies significantly. Approximately one fifth of commercial products that claimed to be R. rosea did not contain rosavin (the key reference markers used to distinguish R. rosea from related species). Moreover some products appeared not to contain salidroside, another marker compound found in other Rhodiola species. Approximately 80% of the remaining commercial products were lower in rosavin content than the registered products and appeared to be adulterated with other Rhodiola species.                  Conclusions:                    The variation in phytochemical constituents present in Rhodiola products available to European buyers via the internet and other sources is a major cause for concern. Adulteration with different species, and other sometimes unknown adulterants, appears to be commonplace. Good quality systems and manufacturing practices, including those required under the THMPD, enable consumers to have confidence that products are authentic and meet a high specification for quality and safety.

turmeric,A diet enriched with curcumin promotes resilience to chronic social defeat stress - PubMed,"              Chronic exposure to stress is a well-known risk factor for the development of mood and anxiety disorders. Promoting resilience to stress may prevent the development of these disorders, but resilience-enhancing compounds are not yet clinically available. One compound that has shown promise in the clinical setting is curcumin, a polyphenol compound found in the rhizome of the turmeric plant (Curcuma longa) with known anti-inflammatory and antidepressant properties. Here, we tested the efficacy of 1.5% dietary curcumin at promoting resilience to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) in 129/SvEv mice, a strain that we show is highly susceptible to this type of stress. We found that administration of curcumin during CSDS produced a 4.5-fold increase in stress resilience, as measured by the social interaction test. Although the overall effects of curcumin were striking, we identified two distinct responses to curcumin. While 64% of defeated mice on curcumin were resilient (responders), the remaining 36% of mice were susceptible to the effects of stress (non-responders). Interestingly, responders released less corticosterone following acute restraint stress and had lower levels of peripheral IL-6 than nonresponders, implicating a role for the NF-κB pathway in treatment response. Importantly, curcumin also prevented anxiety-like behavior in both responders and non-responders in the elevated-plus maze and open field test. Collectively, our findings provide the first preclinical evidence that curcumin promotes resilience to CSDS and suggest that curcumin may prevent the emergence of a range of anxiety-like symptoms when given to individuals during exposure to chronic social stress.

turmeric,Antioxidant potential of fluoxetine in comparison to Curcuma longa in restraint-stressed rats - PubMed,"              Stress plays a potential role in the onset and exacerbation of depression. Chronic restraint stress in rats, and psychosocial stress in humans, is implicated in the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety disorders. Oxidative damage is an established outcome of restraint stress, which has been suggested to induce many damaging processes contributing to the pathology of stress-induced depression. However, the modulatory role of clinically effective antidepressants, such as fluoxetine, in attenuating oxidative stress has not been well characterized. Therefore, the current study was designed to investigate the antioxidant effects of chronic treatment with fluoxetine in animals submitted to restraint stress. The antioxidant potential of the antidepressant fluoxetine was compared with that of turmeric, used as a standard since it integrates both antioxidant and antidepressant properties. Chronic fluoxetine administration to stressed animals for 21 days prevented restraint stress-induced oxidative damage with an efficacy similar to that of turmeric, as evidenced by significant enhancement of key endogenous antioxidant defense components, comprising the free-radical scavenging enzymes, superoxide:superoxide oxidoreductase (EC 1.15.1.1), hydrogen-peroxide:hydrogen-peroxide oxidoreductase (EC 1.11.1.6), glutathione S-transferase (EC 2.5.1.18) and glutathione:NADP(+)oxidoreductase (EC 1.8.1.7), as well as non-enzymatic antioxidants, GSH, glucose and uric acid, which were severely depleted by restraint stress in animals receiving no treatment. Oxidative stress markers, (S)-lactate:NAD(+) oxidoreductase activity (EC 1.1.1.27), malondialdehyde levels (lipid peroxidation product) and protein carbonyl content were also significantly decreased following fluoxetine treatment. Both these drugs when given alone to non-stressed animals did not alter basal levels of antioxidant defense components and oxidative stress markers significantly. Our findings suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of fluoxetine may be mediated, at least partially, via reversal of oxidative damage as demonstrated by protective enhancement of antioxidant status following a stress-induced decline. In addition, this study demonstrates important implications for pharmacological interventions targeting cellular antioxidants as a promising strategy for protecting against oxidative insults in stress-induced depression.

turmeric,"Effects of Turmeric on Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Mental Health, and Serum Homocysteine in Overweight, Obese Females - PubMed","        Context:                    The prevalence of overweight and obesity and associated comorbidities has progressively risen. Curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, and turmeric aqueous extract, a concentrated form, have been reported to have beneficial effects in treatment of cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors. However, turmeric has not been studied in its natural form.                  Objective:                    The present study planned to evaluate the beneficial effects of turmeric in its natural form on obesity-related, cardiovascular-disease risk factors in overweight or obese females.                  Design:                    The study used a pre-post, single-arm design.                  Setting:                    The study took place in the Department of Physiology at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University (Dammam, Saudi Arabia).                  Participants:                    The participants were 36 young female students at the university, with a body mass index ≥ 23 kg/m2.                  Intervention:                    Participants received a daily dose of 2 g/d of turmeric in capsules for 90 d.                  Outcome measures:                    Anthropometric measures, blood pressure, serum homocysteine, and mental health status- stress, anxiety, depression scores-were recorded at baseline and postintervention. Dietary intake and physical activity (confounding variables) were also measured.                  Results:                    The following anthropometric measures were reduced significantly between baseline and postintervention: (1) body weight-73.47 vs 72.45 kg (P = .04), (2) body mass index-28.75 vs 28.27 kg/m2 (P = .02), (3) waist circumference-81.85 vs 77.96 cm (P = .01), (4) hip circumference-102.72 vs 98.10 cm (P = .001), (5) body fat %-34.34 vs 32.58 (P = .00), (6) systolic blood pressure-119.12 vs 115.92 mm Hg (P = .04), and (7) anxiety scores-7.88 vs 4.73 (P = .03), as compared by paired t test. Homocysteine levels and stress and depression scores showed no significant changes. Dietary intake and physical activity did not vary significantly throughout the study period.                  Conclusion:                    Turmeric has the ability to reduce weight, decrease body fat percentage, lower systolic blood pressure, and relieve anxiety for young, obese and overweight females, when given at 2 g/d for 90 d.

turmeric,A blunted anxiolytic like effect of curcumin against acute lead induced anxiety in rat: involvement of serotonin - PubMed,"              Anxiety is one of the most common mental disorders sharing extreme or pathological anxiety states as the primary disturbance in mood or emotional tone, with increased fear and exaggerated acute stress responses. Medicinal plants are very variable, but some of them are used as a spice such as curcumin (Curcuma longa). Curcumin shows a wide range of pharmacological potentialities, however, little is known about its anxiolytic properties. The aim of our study was to assess the anti-anxiety potential of curcumin extract against experimental lead induced-anxiety in rats. Experiments were carried out on male Wistar rats intoxicated acutely with an intraperitoneal injection of Pb (25mg/kg B.W.) and/or concomitantly with administration of curcumin (30 mg/kg B.W.) for 3 days. Using immunohistochemistry and anxiety assessment tests (dark light box and elevated plus maze), we evaluated, respectively, the expression of serotonin (5HT) in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and the anxiety state in our animals. Our results showed, for the first time, a noticeable anxiolytic effect of curcumin against lead induced anxiety in rats and this may possibly result from modulation of central neuronal monoaminergic neurotransmission, especially serotonin, which has shown a significant reduction of the immunoreactivity within the DRN.

turmeric,"Curcumin for the treatment of major depression: a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study - PubMed","        Background:                    Curcumin, the principal curcuminoid derived from the spice turmeric, influences several biological mechanisms associated with major depression, namely those associated with monoaminergic activity, immune-inflammatory and oxidative and nitrosative stress pathways, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and neuroprogression. We hypothesised that curcumin would be effective for the treatment of depressive symptoms in individuals with major depressive disorder.                  Methods:                    In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 56 individuals with major depressive disorder were treated with curcumin (500 mg twice daily) or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary measure was the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-rated version (IDS-SR30). Secondary outcomes included IDS-SR30 factor scores and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).                  Results:                    From baseline to week 4, both curcumin and placebo were associated with improvements in IDS-SR30 total score and most secondary outcome measures. From weeks 4 to 8, curcumin was significantly more effective than placebo in improving several mood-related symptoms, demonstrated by a significant group x time interaction for IDS-SR30 total score (F1, 53=4.22, p=.045) and IDS-SR30 mood score (F1, 53=6.51, p=.014), and a non-significant trend for STAI trait score (F1, 48=2.86, p=.097). Greater efficacy from curcumin treatment was identified in a subgroup of individuals with atypical depression.                  Conclusions:                    Partial support is provided for the antidepressant effects of curcumin in people with major depressive disorder, evidenced by benefits occurring 4 to 8 weeks after treatment.                  Limitations:                    Investigations with larger sample sizes, over extended treatment periods, and with varying curcumin dosages are required.          "
turmeric,"Possible nitric oxide modulation in protective effect of (Curcuma longa, Zingiberaceae) against sleep deprivation-induced behavioral alterations and oxidative damage in mice - PubMed","              Sleep is essential for the physical and mental health of a human being. Problems of sleep deprivation are increasing in modern society nowadays. Recently, various antioxidants have been implicated as neuroprotectants in the treatment of stress and stress related problems. The present study was designed to explore the possible role of nitric oxide in the protective effect of Curcumin (Curcuma longa, Zingiberaceae) against 72-h sleep deprivation-induced behavioral alterations and oxidative damage in mice. 72-h sleep deprivation significantly caused weight loss, anxiety like behavior, impaired locomotor activity and oxidative damage (increased lipid peroxidation, nitrite level and deplete glutathione and catalase activity) in animals. Treatment with Curcumin extract (10 and 20mg/kg, ip) for 5 days significantly prevented weight loss, impairment in locomotor activity, anxiety like effects in all behavioral paradigms tasks (mirror chamber, plus maze, zero maze) as compared to control (72-h sleep-deprived) (P<0.05). Biochemically, Curcumin extract treatment significantly restored depleted reduced glutathione, catalase activity, attenuated raised lipid peroxidation and nitrite level as compared to control (72-h sleep-deprived) animals. Further, pretreatment of l-arginine (50mg/kg, ip), nitric oxide precursor reversed the protective effect of Curcumin (10 mg/kg, ip) (P<0.05). However, pretreatment of l-NAME (5 mg/kg, ip), nitric oxide synthase inhibitor caused a potentiation in the protective effect of Curcumin (P<0.05). The present study suggests that nitric oxide modulation is involved in the protective effect of Curcumin in ameliorating sleep deprivation-induced behavioral alterations and oxidative damage.

turmeric,"Protective effect of Curcumin, the active principle of turmeric (Curcuma longa) in haloperidol-induced orofacial dyskinesia and associated behavioural, biochemical and neurochemical changes in rat brain - PubMed","              Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a motor disorder of the orofacial region resulting from chronic neuroleptic treatment. A high incidence and irreversibility of this hyperkinetic disorder has been considered a major clinical issue in the treatment of schizophrenia. The molecular mechanism related to the pathophysiology of tardive dyskinesia is not completely known. Various animal studies have demonstrated an enhanced oxidative stress and increased glutamatergic transmission as well as inhibition in the glutamate uptake after the chronic administration of haloperidol. The present study investigated the effect of curcumin, an antioxidant, in haloperidol-induced tardive dyskinesia by using different behavioural (orofacial dyskinetic movements, stereotypy, locomotor activity, % retention), biochemical (lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione levels, antioxidant enzyme levels (SOD and catalase) and neurochemical (neurotransmitter levels) parameters. Chronic administration of haloperidol (1 mg/kg i.p. for 21 days) significantly increased vacuous chewing movements (VCM's), tongue protrusions, facial jerking in rats which was dose-dependently inhibited by curcumin. Chronic administration of haloperidol also resulted in increased dopamine receptor sensitivity as evident by increased locomotor activity and stereotypy and also decreased % retention time on elevated plus maze paradigm. Pretreatment with curcumin reversed these behavioral changes. Besides, haloperidol also induced oxidative damage in all major regions of brain which was attenuated by curcumin, especially in the subcortical region containing striatum. On chronic administration of haloperidol, there was a decrease in turnover of dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine in both cortical and subcortical regions which was again dose-dependently reversed by treatment with curcumin. The findings of the present study suggested for the involvement of free radicals in the development of neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia and point to curcumin as a possible therapeutic option to treat this hyperkinetic movement disorder.

turmeric,Ayurveda and COVID-19: Where psychoneuroimmunology and the meaning response meet - PubMed,"              The COVID-19 pandemic has led to high levels of psychological distress in the general public, including symptoms of anxiety and depression. Such distress is associated with alterations in immune function, including an elevated risk of viral respiratory tract infections. In this light, the possible effects of Ayurveda, a traditional system of medicine promoted by the Indian government as an ""immune booster"", are examined from the point of view of psychoneuroimmune mechanisms as well as the ""meaning response"" described by Moerman. It was found that many of the measures advocated in their guidelines could positively influence immunity either by direct effects on symptoms of depression or anxiety, or through their symbolic significance. Therefore, it is possible that such traditional practices could be beneficial both in terms of psychological quality of life, and in terms of moderating the risk of infection.          "
chamomile,An exploratory study of salivary cortisol changes during chamomile extract therapy of moderate to severe generalized anxiety disorder - PubMed,"        Objectives:                    Dysfunctions in stress biology are hypothesized to contribute to anxiety disorders, and to be ameliorated during successful treatment, but limited clinical data exist to support this hypothesis. We evaluated whether increases in morning cortisol and the diurnal cortisol slope, markers of stress biology, are associated with clinical response to chamomile therapy among subjects with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).                  Methods:                    Among 45 subjects with DSM-IV diagnosed GAD in an open-label clinical trial of chamomile, salivary cortisol was assessed for three days each pre- and post-treatment, at 8am, 12pm, 4pm, and 8pm. Mixed model analyses assessed whether GAD symptom change predicted the degree to which cortisol levels changed during treatment.                  Results:                    Symptom improvement during treatment was significantly associated with pre-to-post treatment changes in cortisol. Subjects who experienced more symptomatic improvement experienced significant increases in their morning salivary cortisol (β = 0.48, p < 0.001), and a greater decrease in cortisol from morning to the rest of the day (β = 0.55, p < 0.001). In addition, at baseline a lower cortisol level (β = -0.24, p = 0.023) and a lesser decrease in cortisol after morning (β = 0.30, p = 0.003) were associated with greater symptomatic improvement.                  Conclusion:                    Increases in morning salivary cortisol and the diurnal cortisol slope are associated with symptom improvement in chamomile treatment of GAD. Response to treatment for GAD could partially stem from normalization of stress biology dysfunction, but further work involving establishing abnormalities within-sample, ruling out of confounds (e.g., sleep), and a placebo control is necessary to conclude an amelioration effect.

chamomile,A successful approach to conrol burning mouth syndrome using matricaria recutita and cognitive therapy - PubMed,"              The burning mouth syndrome (BMS) has no specific clinical and laboratory signs. Its etiology is yet to be elucidated, but it is considered to be affected by multifactorial, psychological, and local and systemic factors. This condition is considered of great morbidity, and the main complaint of patients maybe associated with xerostomia, thirst, and altered taste. The present study aims to report two cases of BMS and to evaluate the outcome of cognitive therapy (CT) plus phytotherapy in the control of BMS. The patients were female, Caucasian, and aged between 58 and 69 years. The most BMS-affected anatomical parts were the lips and the tongue. In the clinical approach, oral and systemic evaluation, and disease management with CT plus chamomile tea were done. The patients were reassured, and their response to therapy one year after was found to be excellent despite few exacerbations in periods of great emotional stress. Thus, we conclude that psychological treatment is vital in the management of BMS, as CT, along with Matricaria recutita phytotherapy, displayed excellent results in the control of BMS.

chamomile,GABA-modulating phytomedicines for anxiety: A systematic review of preclinical and clinical evidence - PubMed,"              Anxiety disorders are chronic and functionally disabling conditions with high psychological stress, characterised by cognitive symptoms of excessive worry and focus difficulties and physiological symptoms such as muscle tension and insomnia. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter within the central nervous system and is a key target of pharmacotherapies in the treatment of anxiety. Although current pharmaceutical treatments are often efficacious, they may cause undesirable side effects including cognitive decrements and withdrawal symptoms. Plant-based ""phytomedicines"" may provide novel treatment options, to act as an adjunctive or alternative to existing anxiolytic medications. As such, we conducted a systematic review to assess the current body of literature on anxiolytic phytomedicines and/or phytoconstituents. An open-ended search to 5 July 2017 was conducted using MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, and Cochrane library online databases and performed in a stepped format from preclinical to clinical investigations. Eligible studies must have had (a) in vitro evidence of GABA-modulating activity, (b) animal studies using anxiety models to test an anxiolytic effect, and (c) human clinical trials. Ten phytomedicines were identified as having preclinical investigations showing interaction with the GABA system, in addition to human clinical trials: kava, valerian, pennywort, hops, chamomile, Ginkgo biloba, passionflower, ashwagandha, skullcap, and lemon balm. Collectively, the literature reveals preclinical and clinical evidence for various phytomedicines modulating GABA-pathways, with comparative anxiolytic effect to the current array of pharmaceuticals, along with good safety and tolerability profiles.

ashwagandha,Intermittent fasting combined with supplementation with Ayurvedic herbs reduces anxiety in middle aged female rats by anti-inflammatory pathways - PubMed,"              Intermittent fasting-dietary restriction (IF-DR) is an increasingly popular intervention to promote healthy aging and delay age associated decline in brain functions. Also, the use of herbal interventions is gaining attention due to their non-pharmacological approach to treat several abnormalities and promote general health with least side effects. The present study was aimed to investigate the synergistic effects of IF-DR regimen with herbal supplementation on anxiety-like behavior and neuroinflammation in middle aged female rats. We used dried leaf powder of Withania somnifera and dried stem powder of Tinospora cordifolia for our study. The rats were divided into three groups: (1) Control group fed ad libitum (AL); (2) rats deprived of food for full day and fed ad libitum on every alternate day (IF-DR); and (3) IF-DR and herbal extract (DRH) group in which rats were fed ad libitum with herbal extract supplemented diet, every alternate day. Post regimen, the rats were tested for anxiety-like behavior and further used for study of key inflammatory molecules (NFκB, Iba1, TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6) and glial marker (GFAP) in hippocampus and piriform cortex regions of brain. The study was further extended to explore the effect of DRH regimen on stress response protein (HSP70) and calcium dependent regulators of synaptic plasticity (CaMKIIα, Calcineurin). Our data demonstrated that DRH regimen reduced anxiety-like behavior in middle age female rats and associated neuroinflammation by ameliorating key inflammatory cytokines and modulated stress response. The present data may provide scientific validation for anxiolytic and anti-inflammatory potential of herbal intervention combined with short term IF-DR regimen.          "
ashwagandha,Effect of Pueraria tuberosa tuber extract on chronic foot shock stress in Wistar rats - PubMed,"              The present study was undertaken to explore the protective effects of tuberous root extract of Pueraria tuberosa on chronic foot shock stress (CS) induced physiological, neurobehavioral and neuropathological alterations. Male Wistar rats (120-150 g) were divided into seven groups, consisting of ten animals in each. Group I served as normal, group II as positive control, while group III-VII as test drug treated. P tuberosa tuber extract (PTE) was given to rats of groups III-VI at the doses of 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg respectively, while group VII treated with Withania somnifera rhizome extract (WSE) (100 mg/kg) as reference drug. Group II (stress control) received only equivalent volume of distilled water (0.5 ml/100 g) orally. All the drugs were given orally once/day for 14 consecutive days. The last dose was given 1 h before study. Simultaneously, all the animals (except group I) were subjected to 1 h of foot-shock (2 mA) through a grid floor for those 14 days in a standard conditioning chamber with the escape route closed [Chronic stress (CS)]. Thereafter, the rats were placed on open-field and plus maze apparatus for studying the behavioral patterns of them, and the anxiolytic effects of the putative drug. Sexual activities of the animals were also studied. Finally, the animals were sacrificed and their ulcer formation in gastric mucosa was noted. Weights of adrenals and spleen were also taken. Further, plasma corticosterone levels were estimated spectroflurometrically. Results indicated that, CS significantly altered the behavioral patterns, decreased the sexual urge and activities, damaged the gastric mucosal layers, enhanced plasma corticosterone levels and increased adrenal glands and spleen weights. PTE and WSE showed significant anxiolytic activity, protected the gastric mucosa, lowered plasma corticosterone level (indicating HPA axis inhibition) and negated the hypertrophy of adrenals and spleen. PTE also enhanced the sexual urge and activities in animals exposed to chronic stress. The findings suggest significant anxiolytic and anti-stress properties of PTE, confirming the clinical efficacy of the plant mentioned in Ayurveda (Indian system of traditional medicine).          "
ashwagandha,"Study protocol and rationale for a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) extract on nonrestorative sleep - PubMed","              Nonrestorative sleep (NRS) is one of the cardinal symptoms of insomnia and can occur independent of other components of insomnia. Among the sleep disturbances, NRS has been little studied in the general population, even though this symptom plays an important role in several medical conditions associated with chronic inflammation such as heart disease, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome, as well as various sleep disorders. There is paucity in the literature about effective treatments for NRS. Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) has been demonstrated to reduce anxiety and stress, allowing the body to settle down and prepare for sleep. This study will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled interventional study in NRS population.The NRS participants are identified using Restorative Sleep Questionnaire-weekly version (RSQ-W) questionnaire. Actigraphy and polysomnography are used for the objective assessment of sleep. The other assessments used are Hamilton Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) scales, and C-reactive protein. Routine blood and urine analyses will be conducted to assess the safety of treatment. Duration of study for each participant will be 50 days with ""day one"" for screening followed by randomization for the treatment. The duration for medicine/placebo intake shall be 42 days.Primary outcome will be to evaluate effect of daily supplement of ashwagandha extract compared with placebo in subjects with NRS at 6 weeks from baseline, as assessed by the total score of RSQ-W.

Design:                    Systematic review of the literature, with searches conducted in PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL, and Google Scholar by a medical librarian. Additionally, the reference lists of studies identified in these databases were searched by a research assistant, and queries were conducted in the AYUSH Research Portal. Search terms included ""ashwagandha,"" ""Withania somnifera,"" and terms related to anxiety and stress. Inclusion criteria were human randomized controlled trials with a treatment arm that included WS as a remedy for anxiety or stress. The study team members applied inclusion criteria while screening the records by abstract review.                  Intervention:                    Treatment with any regimen of WS.                  Outcome measures:                    Number and results of studies identified in the review.                  Results:                    Sixty-two abstracts were screened; five human trials met inclusion criteria. Three studies compared several dosage levels of WS extract with placebos using versions of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, with two demonstrating significant benefit of WS versus placebo, and the third demonstrating beneficial effects that approached but did not achieve significance (p=0.05). A fourth study compared naturopathic care with WS versus psychotherapy by using Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scores as an outcome; BAI scores decreased by 56.5% in the WS group and decreased 30.5% for psychotherapy (p<0.0001). A fifth study measured changes in Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores in WS group versus placebo; there was a 44.0% reduction in PSS scores in the WS group and a 5.5% reduction in the placebo group (p<0.0001). All studies exhibited unclear or high risk of bias, and heterogenous design and reporting prevented the possibility of meta-analysis.                  Conclusions:                    All five studies concluded that WS intervention resulted in greater score improvements (significantly in most cases) than placebo in outcomes on anxiety or stress scales. Current evidence should be received with caution because of an assortment of study methods and cases of potential bias.          "
ashwagandha,Direct evidence for GABAergic activity of Withania somnifera on mammalian ionotropic GABAA and GABAρ receptors - PubMed,"        Ethnopharmacological relevance:                    Withania somnifera (WS) has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine as a remedy for debility, stress, nervous exhaustion, insomnia, loss of memory, and to enhance cognitive function. This study provides an empirical evidence to support the traditional use of WS to aid in mental process engaging GABAergic signaling.                  Aim of the study:                    We evaluated the effect of aqueous WS root extract (aqWS), and its two main components, withaferin A and withanolide A, on the main inhibitory receptors in the central nervous system: ionotropic GABAA receptors.                  Materials and methods:                    The pharmacological activity of aqWS, withaferin A and withanolide A, was tested on native rat brain GABAA channels microtransplanted into Xenopus oocytes and GABAρ1 receptors heterologously expressed in oocytes. The GABAergic activity of aqWS compounds was evaluated by the two-electrode voltage-clamp method and the fingerprint of the extract was done by LC-MS.                  Results:                    Concentration-dependent inward ion currents were elicited by aqWS in microtransplanted oocytes with an EC50 equivalent to 4.7 mg/mL and a Hill coefficient (nH) of 1.6. The GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline blocked these currents. Our results show that aqWS activated inotropic GABAA channels but with lower efficacy compared to the endogenous agonist GABA. We also demonstrate for first time that aqWS is a potent agonist of GABAρ1 receptors. GABAρ1 receptors were 27 fold more sensitive to aqWS than GABAA receptors. Furthermore, aqWS activated GABAρ1 receptors eliciting maximum currents that were no significantly different to those produced by GABA (paired t-test; p=0.533). The differential activity on GABAA and GABA ρ1 receptors and the reported lack of significant GABA presence in WS root extract indicates that the GABAergic activity of aqWS is not mediated by GABA. WS main active components, witaferin A and withanolide A, were tested to determine if they were responsible for the activation of the GABA receptors. Neither compound activated GABAA nor GABAρ1 receptors, suggesting that other constituent/s in WS are responsible for GABAA receptor mediated responses.                  Conclusions:                    Our results provide evidence indicating that key constituents in WS may have an important role in the development of pharmacological treatments for neurological disorders associated with GABAergic signaling dysfunction such as general anxiety disorders, sleep disturbances, muscle spasms, and seizures. In addition, the differential activation of GABA receptor subtypes elucidates a potential mechanism by which WS accomplishes its reported adaptogenic properties.          "
ashwagandha,Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal - Modern perspectives of an ancient Rasayana from Ayurveda - PubMed,"        Ethnopharmacological relevance:                    Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal, commonly known as Ashwagandha, is an important medicinal plant that has been used in Ayurvedic and indigenous medicine for more than 3000 years. According to Charaka Samhita, Susruta Samhita and other ancient texts, Ashwagandha is known as Balya (increases strength), Brusya (sexual performance enhancer), vajikari (spermatogenic), Kamarupini (libido-enhancing), Pustida (nourishing).                  Aim of the review:                    This review article documented and critically assessed W. somnifera regarding its ethnopharmacology, traditional use, botanical description, phytochemicals present, pharmacological activities, clinical trials, and marketed formulations.                  Materials and methods:                    The sources of information used in the study are traditional Ayurvedic books like Charaka Samhita, Susruta Samhita, Astanga Hridaya etc, government reports, dissertations, books, research articles and databases like Science-Direct, SciFinder, Web of Science, PubMed, Wiley Online Library, and ACS Publications on Ashwagandha and Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal.                  Results:                    Traditional uses of Ashwagandha in Ayurveda are very prominent in several texts where formulations with various dosage forms have been mentioned in Charaka Samhita, Susruta Samhita, Astanga Hridaya, different nighantus etc. The drugs were identified based on their composition containing Ashwagandha as one of the major ingredients and their medicinal uses. Phytochemical studies on W. somnifera revealed the presence of important chemical constituents such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, alkaloids, saponins, tannins, and withanolides. The phytochemicals showed various pharmacological activities like anti-cancer, immunomodulatory, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, anti-aging, anti-stress/adaptogenic and anti-diabetic. Various clinical trials show that the plant extract and its bioactive compounds are used in the prevention and treatment of many diseases, such as arthritis, impotence, amnesia, anxiety, cancer, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, and others.                  Conclusions:                    Pharmacological data reviewed here revealed that W. somnifera is a potential source for the treatment of a wide range of diseases especially anxiety and other CNS disorders. From its ancient use to its modern application it has been proven to be non-toxic and effective clinically for human health and wellness. W. somnifera based herbal formulation has been marketed in the form of supplement, extract, capsule, powder etc. This review will be helpful to correlate the mechanism of action with the phytochemical profile of this well-known plant from Ayurveda.

ashwagandha,Protective effect of Withania somnifera dunal root extract against protracted social isolation induced behavior in rats - PubMed,"              This study investigated the effect of Withania somnifera Dunal (WS) root extract and diazepam in social isolation induced behavior such as anxiety and depression in rats. Rats were isolated for 6 weeks and the assessment of changed behavior were done on elevated plus maze (EPM) and forced swim test (FST). Isolation reared rats spent less time into the open arms on EPM and significantly increased immobility time in FST compared to group housed rats. WS (100, 200 or 500 mg/kg, oral) and diazepam (1 or 2 mg/kg, ip) dose dependently increased the time spent and entries into the open arms on EPM test and showed the anxiolytic activity. Subeffective dose of WS (50 mg/kg, oral) potentiated the anxiolytic action of diazepam (0.5, 1 or 2 mg/kg, ip). WS (100, 200 or 500 mg/kg, oral) also reduced the immobility time in FST, thus showed antidepressant effect in both group housed and social isolates. The investigations support the use of WS as a mood stabilizer in socially isolation behavior in Ayurveda.          "
ashwagandha,Behavioural and neurochemical evaluation of Perment an herbal formulation in chronic unpredictable mild stress induced depressive model - PubMed,"              Perment, a polyherbal Ayurvedic formulation that contains equal parts of Clitoria ternatea Linn., Withania somnifera Dun., Asparagus racemosus Linn., Bacopa monniera Linn., is used clinically as mood elevators. The aim of the present study was to explore the behavioural effects and to understand possible mode of action of Perment in stress induced depressive model. Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) was used to induce depression in rats. Open field exploratory behaviour, elevated plus maze, social interaction and behavioural despair tests were used to assess behaviour. Using standard protocols plasma noradrenaline, serotonin, corticosterone and brain/adrenal corticosterone levels were measured to support the behavioural effects of Perment. Exposure to CUMS for 21 days caused anxiety and depression in rats, as indicated by significant decrease in locomotor activity in the open field exploratory behaviour test and increased immobility period in the behavioural despair test. Perment predominantly exhibited antidepressant action than anxiolytic activity. Further Perment increased the plasma noradrenaline and serotonin levels in stressed rats. No significant alteration in the brain corticosterone level in stressed rats was observed with Perment treatment. However the adrenal corticosterone level is decreased with Perment. It can be concluded that the Perment formulation exhibited synergistic activity, has a significant antidepressant and anxiolytic activity, which may be mediated through adrenergic and serotonergic system activation. Currently the formulation is clinically used as anxiolytic but the present results suggest that the formulation can also be indicated in patients affected with depression.          "
ashwagandha,"Adaptogenic and Anxiolytic Effects of Ashwagandha Root Extract in Healthy Adults: A Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo-controlled Clinical Study - PubMed","              Background Stress, anxiety and impeded sleep are a frequent feature of life in modern societies. Across socio-economic strata, stress, anxiety and ineffective sleep detract from healthful living and serve as precursors of various ailments. The use of herbs to offset these antecedents and outcomes has greatly increased in recent years. Ashwagandha, an adaptogenic Ayurvedic herb, has been often used to combat and reduce stress and thereby enhance general wellbeing. While there have been other studies documenting the use of Ashwagandha for stress resistance, this is the first study to use a high-concentration root extract while also varying the dosage substantially. Therefore, this is the first study to offer insight into dose-response of a high concentration root extract. Material and methods In this eight-week, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the stress-relieving effect of Ashwagandha root extract was investigated in stressed healthy adults. Sixty male and female participants with a baseline perceived stress scale (PSS) score >20 were randomized to receive capsules of Ashwagandha extract 125 mg, Ashwagandha extract 300 mg or identical placebo twice daily for eight weeks in a 1:1:1 ratio. Stress was assessed using PSS at baseline, four weeks and eight weeks. Anxiety was assessed using the Hamilton-Anxiety (HAM-A) scale and serum cortisol was measured at baseline and at eight weeks. Sleep quality was assessed using a seven-point sleep scale. A repeat measures ANOVA (general linear model) was used for assessment of treatment effect at different time periods. Post-hoc Dunnett's test was used for comparison of two treatments with placebo. Results Two participants (one each in 250 mg/day Ashwagandha and placebo) were lost to follow-up and 58 participants completed the study. A significant reduction in PSS scores was observed with Ashwagandha 250 mg/day (P < 0.05) and 600 mg/day (P < 0.001). Serum cortisol levels reduced with both Ashwagandha 250 mg/day (P < 0.05) and Ashwagandha 600 mg/day (P < 0.0001). Compared to the placebo group participants, the participants receiving Ashwagandha had significant improvement in sleep quality. Conclusion Ashwagandha root aqueous extract was beneficial in reducing stress and anxiety.          "
ashwagandha,Withania somnifera as a potential anxiolytic and immunomodulatory agent in acute sleep deprived female Wistar rats - PubMed,"              Sleep is a profound regulator of cellular immunity, and the curtailment of sleep in present day lifestyle leads to disruption of neuro-immune-endocrine interactions. No therapeutic remedy is yet known for the amelioration of detrimental effects caused by sleep deprivation (SD). The current study was aimed to elucidate the effects of acute SD on immune function and its modulation by water extract from leaves of Withania somnifera (ASH-WEX). Three groups of animals, i.e. Vehicle-Undisturbed sleep (VUD), Vehicle-Sleep deprived (VSD) and ASH-WEX fed sleep deprived (WSD) rats were tested for their anxiety-like behaviour and further used for the study of inflammatory and apoptotic markers expression in piriform cortex and hippocampus regions of the brain. VSD animals showed high level of anxiety in elevated plus maze test, which was ameliorated in WSD group. The stress induced expression of inflammatory and immune response markers GFAP, TNFα, IL-6, OX-18 and OX-42 in VSD animals was found to be modulated by ASH-WEX. Further, the stress induced apoptosis was suppressed in WSD group as indicated by expression of NF-κB, AP-1, Bcl-xL and Cytochrome c. This study provides scientific validation to the anxiolytic, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties of ASH-WEX, which may serve as an effective dietary supplement for management of SD induced stress and associated functional impairments.

Settings and design:                    Single center, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.                  Materials and methods:                    A total of 64 subjects with a history of chronic stress were enrolled into the study after performing relevant clinical examinations and laboratory tests. These included a measurement of serum cortisol, and assessing their scores on standard stress-assessment questionnaires. They were randomized to either the placebo control group or the study drug treatment group, and were asked to take one capsule twice a day for a period of 60 days. In the study drug treatment group, each capsule contained 300 mg of high-concentration full-spectrum extract from the root of the Ashwagandha plant. During the treatment period (on Day 15, Day 30 and Day 45), a follow-up telephone call was made to all subjects to check for treatment compliance and to note any adverse reactions. Final safety and efficacy assessments were done on Day 60.                  Statistical analysis:                    t-test, Mann-Whitney test.                  Results:                    The treatment group that was given the high-concentration full-spectrum Ashwagandha root extract exhibited a significant reduction (P<0.0001) in scores on all the stress-assessment scales on Day 60, relative to the placebo group. The serum cortisol levels were substantially reduced (P=0.0006) in the Ashwagandha group, relative to the placebo group. The adverse effects were mild in nature and were comparable in both the groups. No serious adverse events were reported.                  Conclusion:                    The findings of this study suggest that a high-concentration full-spectrum Ashwagandha root extract safely and effectively improves an individual's resistance towards stress and thereby improves self-assessed quality of life.

ashwagandha,GABA-modulating phytomedicines for anxiety: A systematic review of preclinical and clinical evidence - PubMed,"              Anxiety disorders are chronic and functionally disabling conditions with high psychological stress, characterised by cognitive symptoms of excessive worry and focus difficulties and physiological symptoms such as muscle tension and insomnia. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter within the central nervous system and is a key target of pharmacotherapies in the treatment of anxiety. Although current pharmaceutical treatments are often efficacious, they may cause undesirable side effects including cognitive decrements and withdrawal symptoms. Plant-based ""phytomedicines"" may provide novel treatment options, to act as an adjunctive or alternative to existing anxiolytic medications. As such, we conducted a systematic review to assess the current body of literature on anxiolytic phytomedicines and/or phytoconstituents. An open-ended search to 5 July 2017 was conducted using MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, and Cochrane library online databases and performed in a stepped format from preclinical to clinical investigations. Eligible studies must have had (a) in vitro evidence of GABA-modulating activity, (b) animal studies using anxiety models to test an anxiolytic effect, and (c) human clinical trials. Ten phytomedicines were identified as having preclinical investigations showing interaction with the GABA system, in addition to human clinical trials: kava, valerian, pennywort, hops, chamomile, Ginkgo biloba, passionflower, ashwagandha, skullcap, and lemon balm. Collectively, the literature reveals preclinical and clinical evidence for various phytomedicines modulating GABA-pathways, with comparative anxiolytic effect to the current array of pharmaceuticals, along with good safety and tolerability profiles.

ashwagandha,Withania somnifera Leaf Extract Ameliorates Benzo[a]pyrene-Induced Behavioral and Neuromorphological Alterations by Improving Brain Antioxidant Status in Zebrafish (Danio rerio) - PubMed,"              The aquatic environment provides a sink for the environmental pollutants that have potential to induce oxidative stress by altering neurobehavioral response of aquatic animals. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is known to induce oxidative stress in the brain. Withania somnifera has been used traditionally for its neuroprotective effect in experimental models of neurological disorders. The present study is aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of Withania somnifera leaf extract (WSLE) following exposure to waterborne B[a]P. Wild-type zebrafish (Danio rerio) were designated as naive, control (dimethyl sulfoxide), WSLE, B[a]P, and B[a]P + WSLE groups. Behavioral studies showed reversal in scototaxis (anxiety-like) behavior in B[a]P group and was restored by WSLE cosupplementation in B[a]P + WSLE group. B[a]P-induced altered antioxidant status was ameliorated by WSLE in the B[a]P + WSLE group. Previous studies showed that the periventricular gray zone (PGZ) of the optic tectum in zebrafish brain regulates scototaxis (anxiety-like) behavior. Our histopathological observation showed a significant increase in the pyknotic neuronal counts in PGZ of the B[a]P group and was ameliorated by WSLE cosupplementation. The study showed that the reversal in scototaxis behavior following exposure to waterborne B[a]P might be associated with neuromorphological alterations in PGZ, whereas a pioneer ethnopharmacological approach of WSLE cosupplementation showed its neuroprotective role to restore normal scototaxis of zebrafish. Future research directing toward understanding the role of visual circuit involved with impaired scototaxis behavior in zebrafish might provide new pathological outcomes following exposure to B[a]P.

ashwagandha,Anxiolytic-antidepressant activity of Withania somnifera glycowithanolides: an experimental study - PubMed,"              The roots of Withania somnifera (WS) are used extensively in Ayurveda, the classical Indian system of medicine, and WS is categorized as a rasayana, which are used to promote physical and mental health, to provide defence against disease and adverse environmental factors and to arrest the aging process. WS has been used to stabilize mood in patients with behavioural disturbances. The present study investigated the anxiolytic and antidepressant actions of the bioactive glycowithanolides (WSG), isolated from WS roots, in rats. WSG (20 and 50 mg/kg) was administered orally once daily for 5 days and the results were compared by those elicited by the benzodiazepine lorazepam (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) for anxiolytic studies, and by the tricyclic anti-depressant, imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), for the antidepressant investigations. Both these standard drugs were administered once, 30 min prior to the tests. WSG induced an anxiolytic effect, comparable to that produced by lorazepam, in the elevated plus-maze, social interaction and feeding latency in an unfamiliar environment, tests. Further, both WSG and lorazepam, reduced rat brain levels of tribulin, an endocoid marker of clinical anxiety, when the levels were increased following administration of the anxiogenic agent, pentylenetetrazole. WSG also exhibited an antidepressant effect, comparable with that induced by imipramine, in the forced swim-induced 'behavioural despair' and 'learned helplessness' tests. The investigations support the use of WS as a mood stabilizer in clinical conditions of anxiety and depression in Ayurveda.          "
ashwagandha,Protective effect of Withania somnifera Dunal on the behavioral and biochemical alterations in sleep-disturbed mice (Grid over water suspended method) - PubMed,"              Sleep disruption involves extensive changes in physiological function, including EEG, motor, metabolic, autonomic processes physiological homeostasis and psychological balance that are necessary for physical health. Benzodiazepines are the most widely used drugs for the sleep related problems in spite of their limitations and side effects. Objective of the study was to investigate the protective effect of W. somnifera on the behavioral and biochemical alterations in sleep disturbed mice. Pretreatment with W. somnifera root extract (100. 200 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) significantly protected reduction in body weight, improved the reduced locomotor activity and anxiety levels in animals. Biochemical studies also revealed that W. somnifera (100 and 200 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) pretreatment for five days decreased significantly lipid peroxidation, nitrites levels and improved catalase, and reduced glutathione levels. Co-administration of W. somnifera (100 mg/kg) with diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) improved significantly all the biochemical parameters as compared to their effect per se. Preliminary results suggest that Withania root extract can be used in the management sleep loss and associated oxidative stress.          "
ashwagandha,"An investigation into the stress-relieving and pharmacological actions of an ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) extract: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study - PubMed","        Background:                    Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal) is a herb traditionally used to reduce stress and enhance wellbeing. The aim of this study was to investigate its anxiolytic effects on adults with self-reported high stress and to examine potential mechanisms associated with its therapeutic effects.                  Methods:                    In this 60-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study the stress-relieving and pharmacological activity of an ashwagandha extract was investigated in stressed, healthy adults. Sixty adults were randomly allocated to take either a placebo or 240 mg of a standardized ashwagandha extract (Shoden) once daily. Outcomes were measured using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale -21 (DASS-21), and hormonal changes in cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEA-S), and testosterone.                  Results:                    All participants completed the trial with no adverse events reported. In comparison with the placebo, ashwagandha supplementation was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the HAM-A (P = .040) and a near-significant reduction in the DASS-21 (P = .096). Ashwagandha intake was also associated with greater reductions in morning cortisol (P < .001), and DHEA-S (P = .004) compared with the placebo. Testosterone levels increased in males (P = .038) but not females (P = .989) over time, although this change was not statistically significant compared with the placebo (P = .158).                  Conclusions:                    These findings suggest that ashwagandha's stress-relieving effects may occur via its moderating effect on the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. However, further investigation utilizing larger sample sizes, diverse clinical and cultural populations, and varying treatment dosages are needed to substantiate these findings.                  Trial registration:                    Clinical Trials Registry-India (CTRI registration number: CTRI/2017/08/009449; date of registration 22/08/2017).          "
ashwagandha,"Plant-based medicines for anxiety disorders, part 2: a review of clinical studies with supporting preclinical evidence - PubMed","              Research in the area of herbal psychopharmacology has revealed a variety of promising medicines that may provide benefit in the treatment of general anxiety and specific anxiety disorders. However, a comprehensive review of plant-based anxiolytics has been absent to date. Thus, our aim was to provide a comprehensive narrative review of plant-based medicines that have clinical and/or preclinical evidence of anxiolytic activity. We present the article in two parts. In part one, we reviewed herbal medicines for which only preclinical investigations for anxiolytic activity have been performed. In this current article (part two), we review herbal medicines for which there have been both preclinical and clinical investigations of anxiolytic activity. A search of MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, Scopus and the Cochrane Library databases was conducted (up to 28 October 2012) for English language papers using the search terms 'anxiety' OR 'anxiety disorder' OR 'generalized anxiety disorder' OR 'social phobia' OR 'post-traumatic stress disorder' OR 'panic disorder' OR 'agoraphobia' OR 'obsessive compulsive disorder' in combination with the search terms 'Herb*' OR 'Medicinal Plants' OR 'Botanical Medicine' OR 'Chinese herb*', in addition to individual herbal medicines. This search of the literature revealed 1,525 papers, of which 53 plants were included in the review (having at least one study using the whole plant extract). Of these plants, 21 had human clinical trial evidence (reviewed here in part two), with the other 32 having solely preclinical evidence (reviewed in part one). Support for efficacy was found for chronic use (i.e. greater than one day) of the following herbs in treating a range of anxiety disorders in human clinical trials: Piper methysticum, Matricaria recutita, Ginkgo biloba, Scutellaria lateriflora, Silybum marianum, Passiflora incarnata, Withania somniferum, Galphimia glauca, Centella asiatica, Rhodiola rosea, Echinacea spp., Melissa officinalis and Echium amoenum. For several of the plants studied, conclusions need to be tempered due to methodological issues such as small sample sizes, brief intervention durations and non-replication. Current evidence does not support Hypericum perforatum or Valeriana spp. for any anxiety disorder. Acute anxiolytic activity was found for Centella asiatica, Salvia spp., Melissa officinalis, Passiflora incarnata and Citrus aurantium. Bacopa monnieri has shown anxiolytic effects in people with cognitive decline. The therapeutic application of psychotropic plant-based treatments for anxiety disorders is also discussed, specifically Psychotria viridis and Banisteriopsis caarti (ayahuasca), Psilocybe spp. and cannabidiol-enriched (low tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC)) Cannabis spp.          "

Materials and methods:                    Behavioral procedures of anxiety, depression, and stress were assessed in rats. CT (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) was given once a daily for 7 days via oral route and the efficacy was matched by those elicited by lorazepam (1 mg/kg, p.o.), imipramine (10 mg/kg, p.o.), and Withania somnifera (100 mg/kg, p.o.) for anxiolytic, antidepressant, and antistress studies, respectively. Standard drugs were given 1 time, 30 min preceding the behavioral trials.                  Results:                    One-way analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test was employed to analyze the results. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant as compared to control. CT at 400 mg/kg produced an antianxiety effect equivalent to lorazepam, in the elevated plus maze, open field, and social interaction tests among selected doses of the CT. CT at 400 mg/kg also induced an antidepressant activity similar to imipramine, in the behavioral despair, learned helplessness test, and tail suspension among selected doses of the CT. Moreover, CT at 400 mg/kg produced a significant antistress effect comparable to W. somnifera in water immersion-restraint stress by decreasing ulcer index, adrenal gland weight, and by normalizing the plasma levels of corticosterone, glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels when related to stress control.                  Conclusion:                    The study shows that among the different CT doses, CT at 400 mg/kg possesses significant anxiolytic, antidepressant, and anti-stress effects and has therapeutic beneficial for the management of psychological ailments.

ashwagandha,Withania somnifera as a Potential Anxiolytic and Anti-inflammatory Candidate Against Systemic Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Neuroinflammation - PubMed,"              Reactive gliosis, microgliosis, and subsequent secretion of various inflammatory mediators like cytokines, proteases, reactive oxygen, and nitrogen species are the suggested key players associated with systemic inflammation-driven neuroinflammation and cognitive impairments in various neurological disorders. Conventionally, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are prescribed to suppress inflammation but due to their adverse effects, their usage is not well accepted. Natural products are emerging better therapeutic agents due to their affordability and inherent pleiotropic biological activities. In Ayurveda, Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is well known for its immunomodulatory properties. The current study is an extension of our previous report on in vitro model system and was aimed to investigate anti-neuroinflammatory potential of water extract from the Ashwagandha leaves (ASH-WEX) against systemic LPS-induced neuroinflammation and associated behavioral impairments using in vivo rat model system. Oral feeding of ASH-WEX for 8 weeks significantly ameliorated the anxiety-like behavior as evident from Elevated plus maze test. Suppression of reactive gliosis, inflammatory cytokines production like TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and expression of nitro-oxidative stress enzymes like iNOS, COX2, NOX2 etc were observed in ASH-WEX-treated animals. NFκB, P38, and JNK MAPKs pathways analysis showed their involvement in inflammation suppression which was further confirmed by inhibitor studies. The current study provides first ever preclinical evidence and scientific validation that ASH-WEX exhibits the anti-neuroinflammatory potential against systemic LPS-induced neuroinflammation and ameliorates associated behavioral abnormalities. Aqueous extract from Ashwagandha leaves and its active phytochemicals may prove to be promising candidates to prevent neuroinflammation associated with various neuropathologies.          "
ashwagandha,"Propensity of Withania somnifera to Attenuate Behavioural, Biochemical, and Histological Alterations in Experimental Model of Stroke - PubMed","              The present study was designed to evaluate the beneficial effects of Withania somnifera (WS) pre-supplementation on middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke was induced in the rats by inserting intraluminal suture for 90 min, followed by reperfusion injury for 24 h. The animals were assessed for locomotor functions (by neurological deficit scores, narrow beam walk and rotarod test), cognitive and anxiety-like behavioural functions (by morris water maze and elevated plus maze test). MCAO animals showed significant impairment in locomotor and cognitive functions. Neurobehavioural changes were accompanied by decreased acetylcholinesterase activity, increased oxidative stress in terms of enhanced lipid peroxidation and lowered thiol levels in the MCAO animals. In addition, MCAO animals had cerebral infarcts and the presence of pycnotic nuclei. Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) of MCAO animals revealed a cerebral infarct as a hypoactive area. On the other hand, pre-supplementation with WS (300 mg/kg body weight) for 30 days to MCAO animals was effective in restoring the acetylcholinesterase activity, lipid peroxidation, thiols and attenuated MCAO induced behavioural deficits. WS significantly reduced the cerebral infarct volume and ameliorated histopathological alterations. Improved blood flow was observed in the SPECT images from the brain regions of ischemic rats pre-treated with WS. The results of the study showed a protective effect of WS supplementation in ischemic stroke and are suggestive of its potential application in stroke management.           "
Bergamot,Anxiolytic-Like Effects of Bergamot Essential Oil Are Insensitive to Flumazenil in Rats - PubMed,"              Anxiety disorders are one of the most common mental disorders, and benzodiazepines (BDZs), acting on gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptor complex, represent the most common antianxiety medications in the world. However, chronic BDZ use elicits several adverse reactions. Reportedly, aromatherapy is safer for the management of anxiety. Bergamot essential oil (BEO) extracted from Citrus bergamia Risso et Poiteau fruit, like other essential oils, is widely used in aromatherapy to relieve symptoms of stress-induced anxiety. Interestingly, preclinical data indicate that BEO induces anxiolytic-like/relaxant effects in animal behavioural tasks not superimposable to those of benzodiazepine diazepam. To better elucidate the involvement of GABAergic transmission, the present study examines the effects of pretreatment with flumazenil (FLZ), a benzodiazepine site antagonist, on BEO effects using open-field task (OFT) in rats. The data yielded show that FLZ does not significantly affect behavioural effects of the phytocomplex. These results demonstrate the lack of overlapping between BEO and BDZ behavioural effects, contributing to the characterization of the neurobiological profile of the essential oil for its rational use in aromatherapy.

Bergamot,"Bergamot essential oil attenuate aluminum-induced anxiety-like behavior through antioxidation, anti-inflammatory and GABA regulation in rats - PubMed","              A large number of studies showed that aluminum (Al) has potential neurotoxicity to human and animal bodies. Al-treated animals showed anxiety-like behavior, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) changes. Bergamot essential oil (BEO) is a kind of well-known plant extract from the fresh fruit of bergamot. Previous studies suggested that BEO improved mood and relieved symptoms of stress-induced anxiety. This study was designed to study the effects of BEO on anxiety-like behavior, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and GABA system in aluminum trichloride (AlCl3) treated rats. Results showed that AlCl3 exposure induced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze and the open field test. Moreover, AlCl3 exposure decreased the level of GABA and the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the hippocampus (HP) and the frontal cortex (FC). In addition, AlCl3 exposure increased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and the levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in the HP and the FC. To the contrary, co-administration of BEO and AlCl3 improved the anxiety-like behavior, GABA system, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. These results indicated that BEO can alleviate the anxiety-like behavior of AlCl3-exposed rats through the combined action of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and GABA regulation.          "
Bergamot,Role of 5-HT1A Receptor in the Anxiolytic-Relaxant Effects of Bergamot Essential Oil in Rodent - PubMed,"              The essential oil obtained by the fresh fruit of Citrus bergamia Risso et Poiteau is used worldwide in aromatherapy to reduce pain, facilitate sleep induction, and/or minimize the effects of stress-induced anxiety. Preclinical pharmacological data demonstrate that bergamot essential oil (BEO) modulates specific neurotransmissions and shows an anxiolytic-relaxant effect not superimposable to that of the benzodiazepine diazepam, suggesting that neurotransmissions, other than GABAergic, could be involved. Several studies on essential oils indicate a role for serotonergic (5-HT) neurotransmission in anxiety. Interestingly, among serotonergic receptors, the 5-HT1A subtype seems to play a key role in the control of anxiety. Here, we report that modulation of the 5-HT1A receptor by selective agonist ((±)8-OH-DPAT) or antagonist (WAY-100635) may influence some of the anxiolytic-relaxant effects of BEO in Open Field and Elevated Plus Maze tests.

Bergamot,Acute effects of bergamot oil on anxiety-related behaviour and corticosterone level in rats - PubMed,"              Bergamot essential oil (BEO), Citrus aurantium subsp. bergamia (Risso) Wright & Arn. (Rutaceae), is used widely in aromatherapy to reduce stress and anxiety despite limited scientific evidence. A previous study showed that BEO significantly increased gamma-aminobutyric acid levels in rat hippocampus, suggesting potential anxiolytic properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of BEO (1.0%, 2.5% and 5.0% w/w) administered to rats on both anxiety-related behaviours (the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and hole-board tests) and stress-induced levels of plasma corticosterone in comparison with the effects of diazepam. Inhalation of BEO (1% and 2.5%) and injection of diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly increased the percentage of open arm entries on the EPM. The percentage time spent in the open arms was also significantly enhanced following administration of either BEO (2.5% and 5%) or diazepam. Total arm entries were significantly increased with the highest dose (5%), suggesting an increase in locomotor activity. In the hole-board test, 2.5% BEO and diazepam significantly increased the number of head dips. 2.5% BEO and diazepam attenuated the corticosterone response to acute stress caused by exposure to the EPM. In conclusion, both BEO and diazepam exhibited anxiolytic-like behaviours and attenuated HPA axis activity by reducing the corticosterone response to stress.          "
Bergamot,Neuropharmacology of the essential oil of bergamot - PubMed,"              Bergamot (Citrus bergamia, Risso) is a fruit most knowledgeable for its essential oil (BEO) used in aromatherapy to minimize symptoms of stress-induced anxiety and mild mood disorders and cancer pain though the rational basis for such applications awaits to be discovered. The behavioural and EEG spectrum power effects of BEO correlate well with its exocytotic and carrier-mediated release of discrete amino acids endowed with neurotransmitter function in the mammalian hippocampus supporting the deduction that BEO is able to interfere with normal and pathological synaptic plasticity. The observed neuroprotection in the course of experimental brain ischemia and pain does support this view. In conclusion, the data yielded so far contribute to our understanding of the mode of action of this phytocomplex on nerve tissue under normal and pathological experimental conditions and provide a rational basis for the practical use of BEO in complementary medicine. The opening of a wide venue for future research and translation into clinical settings is also envisaged.          "
Bergamot,[The effects of the inhalation method using essential oils on blood pressure and stress responses of clients with essential hypertension] - PubMed,"        Purpose:                    The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of aromatherapy on blood pressure and stress responses of clients with essential hypertension.                  Method:                    There were fifty-two subjects divided into an essential oil group, placebo group, and control group by random assignment. The application of aromatherapy was the inhalation method of blending oils with lavender, ylangylang, and bergamot once daily for 4 weeks. To evaluate the effects of aromatherapy, blood pressure and pulse were measured two times a week and serum cortisol levels, catecholamine levels, subjective stress, and state anxiety were measured before and after treatment in the three groups. Data was analyzed by repeated measures of ANOVA, one-way ANOVA, and chi(2)-test using the SPSS 10.0 program.                  Results:                    The blood pressure, pulse, subjective stress, state anxiety, and serum cortisol levels among the three groups were significantly statistically different. The differences of catecholamine among the three groups were not significant statistically.                  Conclusion:                    The results suggest that the inhalation method using essential oils can be considered an effective nursing intervention that reduces psychological stress responses and serum cortisol levels, as well as the blood pressure of clients with essential hypertension.

Bergamot,[The effects of aromatherapy on stress and stress responses in adolescents] - PubMed,"        Purpose:                    This study was done to examine the effects of aromatherapy on stress and stress responses in adolescents.                  Methods:                    A two-group cross-over design was used for this study. The experimental treatment was aroma essential oil inhalation and the placebo treatment was carrier oil inhalation using a necklace. The sample included 36 female high school students. Fisher's exact test, t-test, and paired t-test using SPSS/WIN program were used to analyze the data.                  Results:                    Stress levels were significantly lower when the students received the aroma treatment compared to when they received the placebo treatment. The stress responses except salivary IgA levels were significantly lower when the students received the aroma treatment.                  Conclusion:                    Aroma inhalation could be a very effective stress management method for high school students. Therefore, it is recommended that this program be used in clinical practice as an effective nursing intervention for high school students.          "
Bergamot,Citrus bergamia essential oil: from basic research to clinical application - PubMed,"              Citrus bergamia Risso et Poiteau, also known as ""Bergamot,"" is a plant belonging to the Rutaceae family, defined as a hybrid of bitter orange and lemon. It is an endemic plant of the Calabria region (Italy). Bergamot fruit is primarily used for the extraction of its essential oil (bergamot essential oil: BEO), employed in perfume, cosmetics, food, and confections. The aim of this review was to collect recent data from the literature on C. bergamia essential oil and, through a critical analysis, focus on safety and the beneficial effects on human health. Clinical studies on the therapeutic applications of BEO exclusively focus on the field of aromatherapy, suggesting that its use can be useful for reducing anxiety and stress.           "
Bergamot,"Efficacy of bergamot: From anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative mechanisms to clinical applications as preventive agent for cardiovascular morbidity, skin diseases, and mood alterations - PubMed","              We summarize the effects of bergamot (extract, juice, essential oil, and polyphenolic fraction) on cardiovascular, bone, inflammatory, skin diseases, mood alteration, anxiety, pain, and stress. This review included a total of 31 studies (20 studies on humans with 1709 subjects and 11 in animals (rats and mice)). In humans, bergamot-derived extract (BE) exerts positive effects on hyperlipidemia with an oral dose from 150 mg to 1000 mg/day of flavonoids administered from 30 to 180 days, demonstrating an effect on body weight and in modulating total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and HDL. Studies in animals confirm promising data on glucose control (500/1000 mg/day of BE with a treatment lasting 30 days) are available in rats. In animals models, bergamot essential oil (BEO, 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg daily for 20 weeks) increases bone volume, decreases psoriatic plaques, increases skin collagen content, and promotes hair growth. Bergamot juice (20 mg/kg) is promising in terms of pro-inflammatory cytokine reduction. In humans, aromatherapy (from 15 to 30 min) does not appear to be useful in order to reduce stress, anxiety, and nausea, compared to placebo. Compared to baseline, BE topical application and BEO aromatherapy reduce blood diastolic and systolic pressure and could have a significant effect on improving mental conditions.          "
Bergamot,Bergamot Essential Oil Attenuates Anxiety-Like Behaviour in Rats - PubMed,"              Preclinical studies have recently highlighted that bergamot essential oil (BEO) is endowed with remarkable neurobiolological effects. BEO can affect synaptic transmission, modulate electroencephalographic activity and it showed neuroprotective and analgesic properties. The phytocomplex, along with other essential oils, is also widely used in aromatherapy to minimize symptoms of stress-induced anxiety and mild mood disorders. However, only limited preclinical evidences are actually available. This study examined the anxiolytic/sedative-like effects of BEO using an open field task (OFT), an elevated plus-maze task (EPM), and a forced swimming task (FST) in rats. This study further compared behavioural effects of BEO to those of the benzodiazepine diazepam. Analysis of data suggests that BEO induces anxiolytic-like/relaxant effects in animal behavioural tasks not superimposable to those of the DZP. The present observations provide further insight to the pharmacological profile of BEO and support its rational use in aromatherapy.          "
Bergamot,"Effects of bergamot ( Citrus bergamia (Risso) Wright & Arn.) essential oil aromatherapy on mood states, parasympathetic nervous system activity, and salivary cortisol levels in 41 healthy females - PubMed","        Background:                    Bergamot essential oil (BEO) is commonly used against psychological stress and anxiety in aromatherapy. The primary aim of the present study was to obtain first clinical evidence for these psychological and physiological effects. A secondary aim was to achieve some fundamental understanding of the relevant pharmacological processes.                  Methods:                    Endocrinological, physiological, and psychological effects of BEO vapor inhalation on 41 healthy females were tested using a random crossover study design. Volunteers were exposed to 3 experimental setups (rest (R), rest + water vapor (RW), rest + water vapor + bergamot essential oil (RWB)) for 15 min each. Immediately after each setup, saliva samples were collected and the volunteers rested for 10 min. Subsequently, they completed the Profile of Mood States, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Fatigue Self-Check List. High-frequency (HF) heart rate values, an indicator for parasympathetic nervous system activity, were calculated from heart rate variability values measured both during the 15 min of the experiment and during the subsequent 10 min of rest. Salivary cortisol (CS) levels in the saliva samples were analyzed using ELISA.                  Results:                    CS of all 3 conditions R, RW, and RWB were found to be significantly distinct (p = 0.003). In the subsequent multiple comparison test, the CS value of RWB was significantly lower when compared to the R setup. When comparing the HF values of the RWB setup during the 10 min of rest after the experiment to those of RW, this parameter was significantly increased (p = 0.026) in the RWB setup for which scores for negative emotions and fatigue were also improved.                  Conclusion:                    These results demonstrate that BEO inhaled together with water vapor exerts psychological and physiological effects in a relatively short time.          "

Bergamot,Aromatherapy benefits autonomic nervous system regulation for elementary school faculty in taiwan - PubMed,"              Workplace stress-related illness is a serious issue, and consequently many stress reduction methods have been investigated. Aromatherapy is especially for populations that work under high stress. Elementary school teachers are a high-stress working population in Taiwan. In this study, fifty-four elementary school teachers were recruited to evaluate aromatherapy performance on stress reduction. Bergamot essential oil was used for aromatherapy spray for 10 minutes. Blood pressure and autonomic nervous system parameters were recorded 5 minutes before and after the application of the aroma spray. Results showed that there were significant decreases in blood pressure, heart rate, LF power percentage, and LF/HF while there were increases in heart rate variability and HF power percentage (P < .001(∗∗∗)) after application of the aromatherapy spray. Further analysis was investigated by dividing subjects into three background variables (position variables, age variables, gender variables) and anxiety degree groups. All parameters were significantly different for most subgroups, except for the substitute teachers and the light-anxiety group. Parasympathetic nervous system activation was measured after aromatherapy in this study. It encouraged further study for other stress working population by aromatherapy.          "
Bergamot,Aromatherapy and the central nerve system (CNS): therapeutic mechanism and its associated genes - PubMed,"              Molecular medical research on aromatherapy has been steadily increasing for use as an adjuvant therapy in managing psychiatric disorders and to examine its therapeutic mechanisms. Most studies, as well as clinically applied experience, have indicated that various essential oils, such as lavender, lemon and bergamot can help to relieve stress, anxiety, depression and other mood disorders. Most notably, inhalation of essential oils can communicate signals to the olfactory system and stimulate the brain to exert neurotransmitters (e.g. serotonin and dopamine) thereby further regulating mood. However, little research has been done on the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects, thus their mechanism of action remains ambiguous. Several hypotheses have been proposed regarding the therapeutic mechanism of depression. These have mainly centered on possible deficiencies in monoamines, neurotrophins, the neuroendocrine system, c-AMP, cation channels as well as neuroimmune interactions and epigenetics, however the precise mechanism or mechanisms related to depression have yet to be elucidated. In the current study, the effectiveness of aromatherapy for alleviating psychiatric disorders was examined using data collected from previously published studies and our unpublished data. A possible signaling pathway from olfactory system to the central nerve system and the associated key molecular elements of aromatherapy are also proposed.           "

Chinese Skullcap,"Plant-based medicines for anxiety disorders, part 2: a review of clinical studies with supporting preclinical evidence - PubMed","              Research in the area of herbal psychopharmacology has revealed a variety of promising medicines that may provide benefit in the treatment of general anxiety and specific anxiety disorders. However, a comprehensive review of plant-based anxiolytics has been absent to date. Thus, our aim was to provide a comprehensive narrative review of plant-based medicines that have clinical and/or preclinical evidence of anxiolytic activity. We present the article in two parts. In part one, we reviewed herbal medicines for which only preclinical investigations for anxiolytic activity have been performed. In this current article (part two), we review herbal medicines for which there have been both preclinical and clinical investigations of anxiolytic activity. A search of MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, Scopus and the Cochrane Library databases was conducted (up to 28 October 2012) for English language papers using the search terms 'anxiety' OR 'anxiety disorder' OR 'generalized anxiety disorder' OR 'social phobia' OR 'post-traumatic stress disorder' OR 'panic disorder' OR 'agoraphobia' OR 'obsessive compulsive disorder' in combination with the search terms 'Herb*' OR 'Medicinal Plants' OR 'Botanical Medicine' OR 'Chinese herb*', in addition to individual herbal medicines. This search of the literature revealed 1,525 papers, of which 53 plants were included in the review (having at least one study using the whole plant extract). Of these plants, 21 had human clinical trial evidence (reviewed here in part two), with the other 32 having solely preclinical evidence (reviewed in part one). Support for efficacy was found for chronic use (i.e. greater than one day) of the following herbs in treating a range of anxiety disorders in human clinical trials: Piper methysticum, Matricaria recutita, Ginkgo biloba, Scutellaria lateriflora, Silybum marianum, Passiflora incarnata, Withania somniferum, Galphimia glauca, Centella asiatica, Rhodiola rosea, Echinacea spp., Melissa officinalis and Echium amoenum. For several of the plants studied, conclusions need to be tempered due to methodological issues such as small sample sizes, brief intervention durations and non-replication. Current evidence does not support Hypericum perforatum or Valeriana spp. for any anxiety disorder. Acute anxiolytic activity was found for Centella asiatica, Salvia spp., Melissa officinalis, Passiflora incarnata and Citrus aurantium. Bacopa monnieri has shown anxiolytic effects in people with cognitive decline. The therapeutic application of psychotropic plant-based treatments for anxiety disorders is also discussed, specifically Psychotria viridis and Banisteriopsis caarti (ayahuasca), Psilocybe spp. and cannabidiol-enriched (low tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC)) Cannabis spp.          "
Damiana,Perfectionistic concerns predict increases in adolescents' anxiety symptoms: a three-wave longitudinal study - PubMed,"        Background and objectives:                    Although perfectionism has been proposed to be a risk factor for the development of anxiety, research on perfectionism and anxiety symptoms in adolescents is scarce and inconclusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the two higher-order dimensions of perfectionism - perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns - predict the development and maintenance of anxiety symptoms. An additional aim of the present study was to examine potential reciprocal effects of anxiety symptoms predicting increases in perfectionism.                  Design:                    The study used a longitudinal design with three waves spaced 4-5 months apart.                  Methods:                    A non-clinical sample of 489 adolescents aged 12-19 years completed a paper-and-pencil questionnaire.                  Results:                    As expected, results showed a positive effect from perfectionistic concerns to anxiety symptoms, but the effect was restricted to middle-to-late adolescents (16-19 years old): Perfectionistic concerns predicted longitudinal increases in adolescents' anxiety symptoms, whereas perfectionistic strivings did not. Furthermore, anxiety symptoms did not predict increases in perfectionism.                  Conclusions:                    Implications for the understanding of the relationship between perfectionism and anxiety symptoms are discussed.          "
Damiana,Progesterone pretreatment increases the stress response to social isolation in ewes - PubMed,"        Objective:                    In rodents, progesterone (P4) pretreatment increases anxiety and response to stressors. Social isolation is a stressor that generates physiological and behavioural stress responses in sheep. The aim of the study was to compare the stress response of anoestrous ewes previously treated or not with P4 to the social isolation test.                  Design:                    Ten ewes received P4 treatment during 13 d (group P4-W) and another 10 remained untreated as controls (group Con). The ewes were individually isolated in a novel place during 10 min, 24 h after the end of P4 pretreatment and their behaviours were recorded. Cortisol and P4 concentrations as well as body surface temperature were recorded before and after the test.                  Results:                    Ewes of the P4-W group presented higher cortisol levels 0, 10, 20 and 30 min after the social isolation and had greater area under the curve of cortisol compared to Con ewes (41,785%±4,156% vs. 25,682%±4,565% during 75 min). Progesterone and body surface temperature increased after social isolation, with no differences between P4-W and Con ewes. There were no differences in behavioural responses to social isolation.                  Conclusions:                    P4 pretreatment appears to augment the stress response to social isolation in anoestrous ewes.          "
Damiana,A mindfulness intervention to reduce maternal distress in neonatal intensive care: a mixed methods pilot study - PubMed,"              Mothers with an infant in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are at risk for depression, anxiety, and trauma symptoms, with negative implications for maternal-infant bonding, maternal well-being, and infant development. Few interventions to promote NICU mothers' mental health, however, have been developed or tested. This pre-post pilot study assessed feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a mindfulness intervention for NICU mothers. Twenty-seven mothers were recruited from a university NICU and offered a mindfulness intervention via introductory video and audio-recorded practices. Participants completed a baseline self-report survey. After 2 weeks of engaging with intervention materials, participants completed a second survey and in-depth interview. Quantitative data were analyzed using paired t tests; qualitative data were analyzed using thematic coding. Twenty-four women (89%) completed the study. Quantitative data indicated significant improvements in depressive, anxiety, and trauma symptoms, negative coping, NICU-related stress, and sleep (p < 0.05). Qualitative data identified themes of perceived improvements in psychological distress and stress symptoms, self-care, and relationships. Findings support the mindfulness intervention's feasibility, acceptability, and potential promise for reducing maternal distress and promoting well-being. Use of video and audio modalities may facilitate program sustainability and scale up. Further research on the program is merited.          "
Damiana,Effect of resveratrol on behavioral performance of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice in anxiety tests - PubMed,"              The aim of this study was to evaluate with anxiety tests the effect of resveratrol (RSV) on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse behavioral performance at the second and fourth week of treatment. Confirmed diabetic mice (>250 mg/dl of glucose in blood after STZ injection) were treated with RSV (RDM, n=12) or control treated (DM, n=12) for 4 weeks. DM and RDM were tested in the Open Field Test (OFT) and Elevated Plus Maze (EPM). In the second week of RSV treatment, a higher grooming frequency (P<0.05) and a lower defecation and rearing frequency (P<0.05) were detected in the OFT in the RDM group compared with the DM. There was a higher grooming frequency (P<0.05) and higher percentage of entries in open arms (P<0.05) in the RDM group than in the DM group in the EPM. However, in the fourth week of RSV treatment, the only effect observed was a higher grooming frequency in the RDM group than in the DM group (P<0.05) in the EPM. In conclusion, RSV treatment in diabetic mice provoked anxiolytic-like effects in both tests (OFT and EPM), and these effects were observed in a short time window (2 weeks). It is suggested that RSV may help diabetic animals to adapt to new stressing and anxiety situations and thus to improve their welfare.           "
Eleuthro,[Psychosurgical treatment of malignant OCD: three case-reports] - PubMed,"              Surgery can be proposed for some patients affected by psychiatric diseases such as severe, disabling and refractory affective disorders (depression), OCD and chronic anxiety states. It can be performed after a period of evolution of minimum 5 Years and after all other classical treatments have failed. For the last Years, different stereotactic techniques have been used: capsulotomy, cingulotomy, subcaudate tractotomy and limbic leukotomy, performed by radiofrequency thermolesions or radiosurgery (g rays). In the case of OCD, these procedures are supposed to affect some of the neural circuits between the frontal lobes and different structures of the limbic system, considered as central to OCD symptoms. As they cause smaller cerebral lesions than earlier surgical techniques (mostly open surgery techniques), modern stereotactic approaches have less clinical side effects, primarily less deficit in emotional reactivity and motivation. This type of treatment offers some hope to patients seriously disabled by OCD. These surgeries and especially their main side effects are mentioned briefly in this Article. The most current indications for psychosurgery are severe OCD and chronic major depressive disorder. The level of stress should be significant and assessed by clinical and social functioning scale scores (for the OCD: Y-BOCS>25, GAF>50). Patients affected by demential disorders, sociopathic or paranoiac personality disorder, substance abuse should be excluded as well as patients aged 65 Years over and less than 18 Years. Several studies evaluating the results of the surgical treatment showed significant improvement in 54% of cases. and a moderate improvement in 27% of them. These results seem unchanged a few Years later in 56% of cases. Despite the lack of controlled trials of neurosurgery and several bias in published reports, evidence suggests that the condition of intractable OCD patients may improve after this surgery. Although capsulotomy and cingulotomy are mainly used, the superiority of any of these four surgical techniques has not been established yet. In this Article, we reported 3 ""malignant"" OCD cases treated by different psychosurgery techniques: 2 of the cases showed a clinical improvement, whereas the third did not -benefit from surgery. All of them were suffering of OCD since childhood with a gradual clinical impairment, unless the -second patient who presented a severe impairment following an accident causing a ten-day coma. In all three cases social consequences of OCD were important: negative socio-professional and family-life consequences and depressive complication with suicide risk. All patients remained unresponsive or showed a very transient reaction to the other forms of therapy, including varied pharmacotherapy (potentiation pharmacotherapy strategies included), intensive psychotherapy, behavioural therapy and electro-convulsive therapy. Pre- and post-operative assessment included neurological, radiological, psychometric and neuropsychological examination. The free and informed consent of the patient was always required before surgery, notifying the nature of the procedure, the potential risks and outcome. The first patient benefited of a bilateral anterior cingulotomy by thermocoagulation in stereotactic conditions, followed, four years later, by a second complementary one because of a relapse which occurred a few months after the first intervention. A clinical improvement was noticed over a period of two years, though it was not sufficient according to the patient. The second patient benefited of a stereotactic cingulotomy associated with a limbic leucotomy: it was initially efficient on OCD as well as on thymic symptoms. Nevertheless the positive evolution on OCD is not perceived by the patient and has not been assessed until now by clinical rating scales. Anterior cingulotomy is undergone in the third case, who showed a significant improvement. Despite clomipramine administered secondary to the surgery, a slight relapse of obsessive ideas was noticed six months later. The postoperative side effects were transient and regressive after a few months; they were observed especially in the case of tractotomy (oedema and transient frontal syndrome). On the whole, morbidity seemed more important with extensive lesions, whereas recurrence rate may be higher with smaller lesions. We did not observe any consequences on personality or on cognitive functions of these patients. No additional -deficits were observed after surgery. Further research is needed in order to determine the optimal site and size of the lesions in terms of efficacy and safety. Although psychosurgery is still controversial from an ethical view point, this treatment appears to be an ultimate solution for these severe disabled patients. Psychosurgery is a safe and relatively effective treatment which should be carried out by an expert multidisciplinary team in these disorders; surgery should be considered as part of an entire treatment program including an appropriate psychiatric rehabilitation part. Research in this field is currently focused on MRI-guided basal ganglia stimulation techniques which would allow to target specific structures in a reversible way.          "
Eleuthro,Premedication of dogs with acepromazine or pentazocine before euthanasia with carbon monoxide - PubMed,"              Euthanasia of unwanted or sick animals should always be done in a humane manner. This study involving two groups of 12 dogs evaluated a two step method of euthanasia using first acepromazine or pentazocine then inhalation of carbon monoxide. During the experiment, behavioral reactions (anxiety, agitation, vocalization and sphincter relaxation) and physiological parameters (electro-encephalogram, electrocardiogram, arterial blood pressure, respiratory and heart rates and serum cortisol) were monitored. The results showed that both drugs modified many behavioral reactions and physiological changes associated with administration of carbon monoxide. Acepromazine and pentazocine reduced by 25% and 20% respectively the number of dogs that showed vocalization and agitation. In acepromazine premedicated dogs, the duration of these signs was significantly diminished and sphincter relaxation did not occur in more than 50% of cases. Furthermore, with the use of acepromazine, no significant peaks or drastic drops were noticed in the heart and respiratory rates and in the arterial blood pressure. These manifestations are usually related to stress. In light of these results, it is recommended to premedicate dogs with acepromazine before submitting them to euthanasia by carbon monoxide inhalation.          "
Eleuthro,Effect of Nitric Oxide on Basolateral Amygdala on Persistence of Anxiety and Depression in Stressed Male Rats - PubMed,"        Introduction:                    The current study aimed at investigating the role of Nitric Oxide (NO) in the maintenance of anxiety and depression induced by stress in male Wistar rats using intra-Basolateral Amygdala (BLA) injection of NO precursor, L-arginine, Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) inhibitor, and L-NAME.                  Methods:                    Two 23-gauge stainless steel cannulas were placed in the BLA, stereotaxically. Seven days later, animals experienced electro foot shock stress based on the following protocol: animals experienced four sessions of stress for 60 minutes in four consecutive days. Five minutes before each stress session, the animals received different doses of L-arginine or L-NAME (1, 5 and, 10 μg/rat) or saline (0.5 μL/rat) intra-BLA. Six days after the stress termination, animals were tested for maintenance of anxiety-like behavior (elevated plus maze; EPM) and eight days after the stress they were examined for depression (forced swimming test; FST).                  Results:                    Stress reduced the time and number of open arms and decreased motor activity on EPM. Stress-induced anxiety was inhibited by L-arginine and L-NAME (1, 5, and 10 μg/rat). L-Arginine and L-NAME induced anxiety in non-stressed rats. Stress also increased the immobility time in animals in FST paradigm. Interestingly, both L-arginine and L-NAME, in all doses reduced the stress effect.                  Conclusion:                    BLA nitric oxide may play a pivotal role in anxiety and depression induced by stress in rats. Since the effects of both L-arginine and L-NAME were similar, NO might have a modulatory role in the BLA.          "
Eleuthro,"Psycho-social stress, insomnia and temazepam: a sleep laboratory evaluation in a ""general practice"" sample - PubMed","              Taking a population of women most of whom were about to seek medication from their general practitioner for stress-induced insomnia, this sleep laboratory study examined--both electro -physiologically and psychologically--the immediate impact of temazepam, at normal prescribed dosage, on sleep. The study was double-blind, controlled with random allocation. Temazepam 20 mg, prepared as a liquid in a soft gelatin capsule, reduced sleep latency and prolonged total sleep time. A reduction in stage shifts to Stages I and II and a reduction in time spent in Stages 0 + I suggest more restful sleep. The sleep ""architecture"" (including REM/NREM cycling, total SWS and REM time) was relatively undisturbed. Temazepam would seem to be effective as a first-line hypnotic for short-term use in stressed patients.          "
Eleuthro,"Effect of electro-acupuncture, massage, mud, and sauna therapies in patient with rheumatoid arthritis - PubMed","              A 48-year-old married woman diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 2007, came to our hospital in July 2014 with the complaint of severe pain and swelling over multiple joints, especially over small joints, which was associated with stiffness (more in morning), deformities of fingers and toes, with disturbed sleep and poor quality of life (QOL) for the past 7 years. She received a combination of electro acupuncture (14 sessions), massage (18 sessions), mud (18 sessions), and sauna (3 sessions) (EMMS) therapies for 30-min, 45-min, 30-min, and 15-min per session, respectively for 3 weeks. During and postintervention assessment showed reduction in visual analog scale score for pain, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores. It also showed an increase in the scores of 10-Meter Walk Test, isometric hand-grip test, and short form-36 version-2 health survey. This result suggest that, the EMMS therapy might be considered as an effective treatments in reducing pain, depression, anxiety, and stress with improvement in physical functions, quality of sleep and QOL in patient with RA. EMMS therapies were tolerated and no side effects were reported by the patient. Though the results are encouraging, further studies are required with larger sample size and advanced inflammatory markers.           "
Eleuthro,[Visual cortical evoked potentials in emotionally unstable persons threatened with electrocutaneous stimulation] - PubMed,"              In preliminarily selected (by a number of parameters) highly emotional subjects, evoked potentials were recorded from parietal, central, frontal and temporal cortical areas, in the first part of the experiment -- in response to indifferent light flashes (which served as a signal to achieve a precise movement), and in the second part -- in response to the same flashes, but with preliminary information of the subject on a possible electrocutaneous stimulation (in case of an error in task performing). It is found that with the threat of the electro-cutaneous stimulation the major changes are observed in the frontal, temporal and central areas. An increase in the latencies of the IV, V, VI components and P300 wave was recorded. At the same time the amplitude of the V component and that of the P300 wave decreased. The IV component was enhanced. In extreme situation the activity directed to avoid the electrostimulation was disturbed (errors of movement performance increased by 3.7 kg). The cortical mechanisms of the organization of the emotional behaviour in extreme situations are discussed.          "
Eleuthro,[Prediction by a man of his readiness to deliberately inhibit fear in anticipation of probable presentation of stressful stimuli] - PubMed,"              Subjects with high tested anxiety which correlated with a rapid elaboration and stability of conditioned skin-galvanic reflex (SGR) to a signal of the hand electro-cutaneous stimulation, were trained to prognosticate their probable success in voluntarily suppressing the conditioned SGR with the purpose of avoiding stimulation. By taking a decision in assessing their current emotional state on the base of signals of visual feedback (SGR trace on the oscilloscope screen), they sanctioned the probability of presentation to them of the conditioned stimulus from a certain moment of the training session. The decision was preceded by extinction of SGR waves evoked by mental intention to be subjected to the test in a situation of risk.          "
Eleuthro,[Euthanasia of piglets: gas or injection?] - PubMed,"              Methods for the humane killing of animals are watched critically by both the public and the veterinary community. Evaluation of such methods requires assessment of efficacy as well as emotional and ethical aspects. Rapidity of loss of consciousness is a crucial factor in such evaluations. In the present study, four methods for piglet euthanasia were compared with regard to presence of indicators of discomfort (pain, anxiety, stress) and rapidity of onset of death, defined as the absence of breathing, heart beats and reflexes, combined with isoelectricity of the electro-encephalogram (EEG). The study was performed on piglets, which had to be destroyed on account of preventive measures against swine fever. The following methods were applied: CO2 98%, CO2/O2 65/35%, T61 and pentobarbital (Euthesate) injected intracardially. Intracardial injections of T61 and pentobarbital provide fast unconsciousness and death with minimal discomfort to the animal.          "
Eleuthro,Electro-Acupuncture Alleviates Chronic Unpredictable Stress-Induced Depressive- and Anxiety-Like Behavior and Hippocampal Neuroinflammation in Rat Model of Depression - PubMed,"              Depression is the second leading cause of disability worldwide. The effects of clinical depression may be mediated by neuroinflammation such as activation of microglia and high levels of proinflammatory cytokines in certain brain areas. Traditional Chinese medicine techniques such as electro-acupuncture (EA) are used extensively in Asia to treat mental health disorders. However, EA has not been rigorously studied in treatment of depression. This study was designed to assess the effectiveness of EA on depressive-like behavior and explore the role of hippocampal neuroinflammation in the potential antidepressant effect of EA. In this study, we used six chronic unpredictable stressors daily in a random sequence for 10 weeks. EA were performed on ""Bai-Hui"" (Du-20) (+) and ""Yang-Ling-Quan"" (GB-34, the right side; -) acupoints by an EA apparatus (HANS Electronic Apparatus, LH202H, 2/100 Hz, 0.3 mA) for 30 min once every other day for last 4 weeks. The behavior tests including open field test and forced swimming test, which are widely used to assess depressive and anxiety-like behavior were performed on the Monday and Tuesday of the eleventh week. The results showed that 10 week of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) caused behavioral deficits in rats and neuroinflammation in hippocampus, such as increased expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components, upregulated mRNA level of IL-1β and the protein level of IL-1β mature form (p17) and activation of microglia. Moreover, 4 weeks of EA treatment significantly attenuated behavioral deficits caused by CUS. EA's antidepressant effect was accompanied by markedly decreased expression of certain NLRP3 inflammasome components and matured IL-1β. Meanwhile, EA treatment can significantly reverse CUS-induced increases in P2X7 receptor, Iba-1, IL-18, TNFα and IL-6 expression and decreases in GFAP expression. In conclusion, EA exhibited the antidepressant effect and alleviated the hippocampal neuroinflammation. These findings may provide insight into the role of hippocampal neuroinflammation in the antidepressant effect of EA.          "
Eleuthro,"[The effect of chronic stress, long-term adaptation to hypoxia and their combination on the behavior of rats with different typological characteristics] - PubMed","              Chronic stress caused by 3-week electro-pain stimulation (4 h daily) combined with ""white noise"", resulted in a decrease of horizontal motor activity of rats with extreme types of behaviour, i.e., active and passive. No changes in behaviour of animals with intermediate behavioural type were found. Long-term (30 days) adaptation to hypoxia (daily lifting to 11,000 m for 5 h) did not cause changes in behaviour of rats. Combination of stress and hypoxia caused an increase of number of grooming acts in rats with passive type of behaviour, testifying to their increased anxiety. Long-term adaptation to hypoxia did not influence the degree of loss of motor activity caused by chronic stress in animals with active and passive types of behaviour.          "
Eleuthro,Acupuncture mechanisms for clinically relevant long-term effects--reconsideration and a hypothesis - PubMed,"              From the author's direct involvement in clinical research, the conclusion has been drawn that clinically relevant long-term pain relieving effects of acupuncture (>6 months) can be seen in a proportion of patients with nociceptive pain. The mechanisms behind such effects are considered in this paper. From the existing experimental data some important conclusions can be drawn: 1. Much of the animal research only represents short-term hypoalgesia probably induced by the mechanisms behind stress-induced analgesia (SIA) and the activation of diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC). 2. Almost all experimental acupuncture research has been performed with electro-acupuncture (EA) even though therapeutic acupuncture is mostly gentle manual acupuncture (MA). 3. Most of the experimental human acupuncture pain threshold (PT) research shows only fast and very short-term hypoalgesia, and, importantly, PT elevation in humans does not predict the clinical outcome. 4. The effects of acupuncture may be divided into two main components--acupuncture analgesia and therapeutic acupuncture. A hypothesis on the mechanisms of therapeutic acupuncture will include: 1. Peripheral events that might improve tissue healing and give rise to local pain relief through axon reflexes, the release of neuropeptides with trophic effects, dichotomising nerve fibres and local endorphins. 2. Spinal mechanisms, for example, gate-control, long-term depression, propriospinal inhibition and the balance between long-term depression and long-term potentiation. 3. Supraspinal mechanisms through the descending pain inhibitory system, DNIC, the sympathetic nervous system and the HPA-axis. Is oxytocin also involved in the long-term effects? 4. Cortical, psychological, ""placebo"" mechanisms from counselling, reassurance and anxiety reduction.          "
Eleuthro,Effect of acupuncture on patients with insomnia: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial - PubMed,"        Background:                    Hypnotic drugs tend to be the dominant form of treatment of insomnia, but these come with a number of reported side effects. Acupuncture has been studied as an alternative, resulting in a rising need for methodological research towards verifying its efficacy as insomnia treatment.                  Methods/design:                    We describe a proposal for a single-center, patient-assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms. A total of 38 patients complete screening tests at the first visit, are registered into the clinical trial, and then randomly assigned to the experimental or sham control groups (19 patients for each group). All subjects are clinical insomnia patients who score a 6 or above on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and meet all inclusion criteria. All subjects are treated with acupuncture and intradermal acupuncture (IDA) three times during the first week. Five sham acupoints are used in the control group. In the experimental group, five real acupoints (PC6, SP6, HT7, KI6, and BL62) are used unilaterally in turn. Sham acupoints are over 1 cm away from each real acupoint.The primary outcomes are the scores on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and PSQI. Secondary outcomes are the sleep log, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the World Health Organization Quality of Life Abbreviated Version (WHOQOL-BREF), the Korean-Auditory Verbal Learning Test (K-AVLT), the Digit Span Test (DS), Event Related Potentials (ERPs) and heart rate variability (HRV) to assess emotional states, sleep quality, cognitive functioning, and electro-physiological changes.Subjects are assessed at three time points: baseline, post-treatment and follow-up. The duration of the clinical trial is 18 days.                  Discussion:                    To study the enhancement of the effectiveness of acupuncture for insomnia, we test the intradermal acupuncture method, which is performed continuously on the subject's skin and stimulated at home by the subject every night. In the trial, objective measurements including ERPs and HRV are used to evaluate states of cognition and autonomic nervous system functioning and subjective self-report questionnaires assess insomnia symptoms.'Sham' acupuncture points provided by STRICTA are used for the control group.

Eleuthro,Clinical studies on treatment of earthquake-caused posttraumatic stress disorder using electroacupuncture - PubMed,"              The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture in 138 patients with earthquake-caused PTSD using Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs). 138 cases enrolled were randomly assigned to an electro-acupuncture group and a paroxetine group. The electro-acupuncture group was treated by scalp electro-acupuncture on Baihui (GV 20), Sishencong (EX-HN 1), Shenting (GV 24), and Fengchi (GB 20), and the paroxetine group was treated with simple oral administration of paroxetine. The efficacy and safety of the electro-acupuncture on treatment of 69 PTSD patients were evaluated using Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) according to clinical data. The total scores of CAPS, HAMD, and HAMA in the two groups after treatment showed significant efficacy compared to those before treatment. The comparison of reduction in the scores of CAPS, HAMD, and HAMA between the two groups suggested that the efficacy in the treated group was better than that in the paroxetine group. The present study suggested that the electro-acupuncture and paroxetine groups have significant changes in test PTSD, but the electro-acupuncture 2 group was more significant.          "
Eleuthro,Quantitative evaluation of distant student psychophysical responses during the e-learning processes - PubMed,"              Using 4 biometric sensors, including GSR (Galvanic Skin Response), BVP (Blood Volume Pulse), EKG (Electro Cardio Grapy) and EEG (Electro Encephalon Grapy), this paper proposes to attempt to correlate the presentation of relaxing, engaging or stressful content to the subjective measures provided by participants in experiments. Once the participant interacts with content from one of the 3 conditions, they may or may not be selectively relaxed, engaged or stressed, and their scores on a psychological self-questionnaire (STAI: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) should show that. From correlating the subjective ratings with the experimental conditions, is proposed to allow to develop algorithms that can be used to classify learners' affective state during synchronous or asynchronous coursework. It is proposed that the algorithm could be used synchronously for the teacher to get student feedback in real time.          "
Eleuthro,Sleep pathophysiology in posttraumatic stress disorder and idiopathic nightmare sufferers - PubMed,"        Background:                    Nightmares are common in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but they also frequently occur in idiopathic form. Findings associated with sleep disturbances in these two groups have been inconsistent, and sparse for idiopathic nightmares. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether sleep anomalies in PTSD sufferers with frequent nightmares (P-NM) differ from those observed in non-PTSD, idiopathic nightmare (I-NM) sufferers and healthy individuals.                  Methods:                    Sleep measures were obtained from nine P-NM sufferers, 11 I-NM sufferers, and 13 healthy control subjects. All participants slept in the laboratory for two consecutive nights where electroencephalogram, electro-oculogram, chin and leg electromyogram, electrocardiogram, and respiration were recorded continuously.                  Results:                    Posttraumatic nightmare sufferers had significantly more nocturnal awakenings than did I-NM sufferers and control subjects. Elevated indices of periodic leg movements (PLMs) during rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep characterized both P-NM and I-NM sufferers.                  Conclusions:                    Posttraumatic nightmare sufferers exhibit more nocturnal awakenings than do I-NM sufferers and control subjects, which supports the hypothesis of hyperarousal in sleep in PTSD sufferers; however, elevated PLM indices in both P-NM and I-NM sufferers suggest that PLMs may not be a marker of hyperarousal in sleep of PTSD sufferers. Rather, PLMs may be a correlate of processes contributing to intense negative dreaming.          "
Folic acid,Reduced nerve growth factor levels in stress-related brain regions of folate-deficient mice - PubMed,"              Folate deficiency has been linked to neurodegenerative and stress-related diseases such as stroke, dementia and depression. The role of the neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) in stress-related disorders and neurodegeneration has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Uracil misincorporation is involved in the neuropsychiatric dysfunction induced by experimental folate deprivation. However, the effects of folate deficiency on the expression of NGF and NT-3 in brain tissue have not yet been investigated. In a 2×2 design, aged mice lacking uracil-DNA N-glycosylase (Ung(-/-)) versus wild-type (Ung(+/+)) controls were subjected to a folate-deficient diet versus a regular diet for three months. Independent of genotype, folate deficiency led to decreased NGF protein levels in the frontal cortex and amygdala. In the hippocampus, NGF levels were increased in UNG(-/-) mice on the normal diet, but not under folate deficiency, while in UNG(+/+) mice, folate deprivation did not affect hippocampal NGF content. NT-3 protein concentrations were neither affected by genotype nor by folate deficiency. Altogether, the results of our study show that folate deficiency affects NGF levels in the frontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus. The decrease in NGF content in the hippocampus in response to folate deficiency in Ung(-/-) mice may contribute to their phenotype of enhanced anxiety and despair-like behavior as well as to selective hippocampal neurodegeneration.

Folic acid,Serum folate and fetal growth retardation: a matter of compliance? - PubMed,"              Serum folate levels were measured at 30 weeks' gestational age in 289 pregnant women, each of whom had been provided with folate supplementation at enrollment in prenatal care. There was a significant association between low serum folate levels and fetal growth retardation. High folate levels were most likely explained by recent folic acid intake. Therefore, we were concerned that the decreased fetal growth associated with low folate levels may have been related to a combination of psychological and behavioral characteristics for which low serum folate levels were only a surrogate measure. A profile of maternal psychosocial status was created, which included measures of depression, anxiety, self-esteem, mastery, stress, and social support. Poorer psychological scores were significantly related to lower serum folate levels. However, in women with both good and poor psychosocial scores, high folate levels were significantly associated with increased birth weight, a relationship that persisted even after adjusting for maternal race, body mass index, smoking, history of a low birth weight infant, and infant gender. Our findings suggest that women with good psychosocial scores are more likely to take folate, but that the use of folate itself is related to a lower risk of fetal growth retardation and increased birth weight.

Folic acid,Audit of primary care and initial secondary care investigations set against RCOG guidelines as standard in cases of subfertility - PubMed,"              Subfertility affects one in seven couples in the United Kingdom and is associated with considerable patient stress and anxiety. The RCOG, with the publication of the evidence-based guidelines, gives us clear recommendations on the initial investigation of the infertile couple. Against these guidelines we audited patient care over a period of 5 months in a dedicated consultant-led infertility clinic. Our results show that a considerable number of patients failed to have the correct advice clearly documented, and the initial primary care investigations of mid-luteal progesterone and semen analysis were performed correctly with results available in only 33% and 2% of occasions, respectively. There were, however, areas where the guidelines were adhered to very efficiently. To improve care we recommend the use of an infertility referral form for use in primary care upon which the practitioners can fill in the appropriate details and be guided on the necessary investigations.

Folic acid,A longitudinal study of antenatal and perinatal risk factors in early childhood cognition: Evidence from Growing Up in New Zealand - PubMed,"        Background:                    Poor maternal health, disadvantageous exposures during pregnancy and unfavourable perinatal events are associated with adverse trajectories in offspring cognitive development.                  Aim:                    To examine longitudinal associations between antenatal maternal, perinatal and maternal health characteristics and children's early cognitive development across executive control, motor ability and receptive language domains.                  Study design, subjects and outcome measures:                    Analyses comprised interview and observational data from 4587 children and their mothers enrolled in the longitudinal Growing Up in New Zealand cohort study. Children's executive control (Luria hand clap task), motor skills (mothers' report) and receptive language ability (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test) were assessed at age 4.5 years. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted, controlling for sociodemographic factors.                  Results:                    Smoking pre- and during pregnancy, no folate intake during first trimester and low birth weight were risk factors for poorer executive control. Perceived stress during pregnancy, no folate intake during first trimester and low birth weight were all risk factors for poorer motor ability. Smoking pre-pregnancy, antenatal anxiety and no folate intake during first trimester were risk factors for poorer receptive language ability.                  Conclusion:                    Adverse ante- and perinatal environments are associated with poorer executive control, motor and receptive language abilities in early childhood. Improving maternal education and support especially for more disadvantaged mothers during pregnancy may reduce the potential deleterious impact of adverse ante- and perinatal conditions on children's early cognition.

Folic acid,"Erythrocyte fatty acid profiles and plasma homocysteine, folate and vitamin B6 and B12 in recurrent depression: Implications for co-morbidity with cardiovascular disease - PubMed","              Oxidative stress induced interactions between fatty acid (FA) and one-carbon metabolism may be involved in co-occurrence of major depressive disorder (MDD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which have been scarcely studied together. In 137 recurrent MDD-patients vs. 73 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, we simultaneously measured key components of one-carbon metabolism in plasma (homocysteine, folate, vitamins B6 and B12), and of FA-metabolism in red blood cell membranes [main polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (AA) and structural FA-indices (chain length, unsaturation, peroxidation)]. Results show significant positive associations of folate with EPA, DHA, and the peroxidation index, which were similar in patients and controls. After correction for confounders, these associations were lost except for EPA. Associations between B-vitamins and FA-parameters were non-significant, but also similar in patients and controls. Homocysteine and DHA were significantly less negatively associated in patients than in controls. In conclusion, these data indicate similarities but also differences in associations between parameters of one-carbon and FA-metabolism in recurrent MDD patients vs. controls, which may reflect differences in handling of oxidative stress. Further research should test the consequences of these differences, particularly the premature development of CVD in MDD.           "
Folic acid,Salivary cortisol and anxiety in recurrent aphthous stomatitis - PubMed,"              Anxiety and salivary cortisol were measured in two groups of patients with recurrent aphthous ulceration. One group of patients had persistent aphthae (Group 1) and the others had been relieved of their aphthae following correction of detected haematinic deficiency states (Group 2). Anxiety was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale and radioimmunoassay of salivary cortisol. There was a statistically significant increased proportion of borderline or clinically anxious patients in Group 1 compared to Group 2 (P < 0.05). Median salivary cortisol levels also showed a statistically significant elevation in Group 1 (P < 0.01). It is concluded that stress may play a role in the aetiology of recurrent aphthous stomatitis, particularly in patients who have an underlying anxiety trait.          "
Folic acid,"Correlations Between Nutrition Habits, Anxiety and Metabolic Parameters in Greek Healthy Adults - PubMed","        Background:                    Anxiety combined with nervousness and apprehension consist a focal response to different life conditions. Lifestyle habits, anxiety and biochemical markers are in a constant interaction.                  Aim:                    To investigate the prevalence of anxiety in healthy adults and its possible association with biochemical factors-lipid profile, liver markers, thyroid hormones-and lifestyle habits.                  Methods:                    Quantitative descriptive correlation study. A total of 100 healthy adults participated in the research. A specially designed questionnaire and Hamilton's scale were used. Anthropometric and biochemical analyses were performed.                  Findings:                    Overall, 61% of the participants presented moderate to very serious anxiety. The average score on the Hamilton scale was 13.82 (±9.000), with men exhibiting less stress than women. For p ≤ 0.05: Stress was positively correlated with impaired thyroid and hepatic function. Hepatic function was affected by both sugar products and water melon, which were positively correlated with total bilirubin and AST/SGOT respectively. Tomato, peppers and legumes were negatively correlated with AST/SGOT. Deep fried food was positively correlated with GGT and triglycerides. Legumes and fish were negatively correlated with CPK. Regarding the lipid metabolism, it was found that food cooked with oil was positively associated with uric acid, but non-cooked olive oil was negatively correlated with the risk for CAD. Thyroid function was negatively correlated with non-homemade food and pasta consumption and positively correlated with consumption of whole grains and green tea. Participants with subclinical hypothyroidism seemed to consume less vitamin B12, folic acid and vegetables.                  Conclusion:                    No direct correlation between lifestyle habits and anxiety was found. Nevertheless, eating habits influenced biochemical markers-especially the thyroid hormones-which may be indirectly responsible for anxiety and related moods.          "
Folic acid,Acne vulgaris: nutritional factors may be influencing psychological sequelae - PubMed,"              Acne vulgaris is a distressing skin condition which can carry with it significant psychological disability. Patients with acne are more likely to experience anger and are at increased risk of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation. Certain nutrients which have been implicated as influencing the pathophysiology of acne have also been identified as important mediators of human cognition, behavior and emotions. Zinc, folic acid, selenium, chromium and omega-3 fatty acids are all examples of nutrients which have been shown to influence depression, anger and/or anxiety. These same nutrients, along with systemic oxidative stress and an altered intestinal microflora have been implicated in acne vulgaris. It is our contention that certain nutritional factors, a weakened antioxidant defense system and altered intestinal microflora may interplay to increase the risk of psychological sequelae in acne vulgaris.

Folic acid,Effect of folic acid in prenatal alcohol induced behavioral impairment in Swiss albino mice - PubMed,"        Background:                    Alcohol is a potent teratogen inducing oxidative stress as well as a massive wave of apoptosis in the developing brain as well as oxidative stress. It affects brain including cerebellum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex resulting into motor and cognitive deficits. Alcohol depletes folic acid from the body which is essential for synthesis of DNA, RNA and protein during cell division and proved to prevent many brain related malformations.                  Purpose:                    The objective of the present study was to study whether folic acid reduces behavioral impairments that were induced by prenatal exposure to ethanol in mice.                  Methods:                    Pregnant mice were divided into different experimental groups. Group I termed as control receiving distilled water, group II received ethanol, group III ethanol and folic acid and group IV folic acid only from gestational days 6 to 15. The dams were allowed to deliver their offspring naturally and until weaning the pups remained with their natural mothers. At the age of 8-9 weeks, they were subjected to battery of various behavioral tests.                  Results:                    The alcohol exposed dams showed decreased motor activity in open field test and decreased exploration and increased anxiety in elevated maze test as compared to controls. Folic acid administration reduced the intensity of these effects of alcohol in mice.                  Conclusion:                    The exposure to alcohol in utero produces long lasting effect on the developing pharmacological character of brain affecting postnatal behavioral expression which may be reduced by prenatal folic acid administration.

Folic acid,Risk factors and health profiles of recent migrant women who experienced violence associated with pregnancy - PubMed,"        Background:                    Violence associated with pregnancy is a major public health concern, but little is known about it in recent migrant women. This study looked at (1) risk factors for violence associated with pregnancy among newly arrived migrant women in Canada and (2) if those who experienced violence associated with pregnancy had a different health profile or use of healthcare services for themselves or their infants during pregnancy and up to 4 months postpartum compared to other childbearing migrant women.                  Methods:                    Pregnant migrant women in Canada <5 years were recruited in 12 hospitals in 3 large cities between 2006 and 2009 and followed to 4 months postpartum. Data were collected on maternal background, migration history, violence associated with pregnancy, maternal and infant physical and mental health, and services used.                  Results:                    Of a total of 774 pregnant migrant women, 59 (7.6%) women reported violence associated with pregnancy. Migrant women who experienced violence, compared to those who did not, were at increased risk of violence if they lived without a partner, were asylum seekers, migrated <2 years ago, or had less than high school education. Women who reported violence were less likely to have up-to-date vaccinations, take folic acid before pregnancy, more likely to commence prenatal care after 3 months gestation and to not use contraceptives after birth. They were also more likely to have a history of miscarriage and report more postpartum pain and increased bleeding. They were also more likely to have inadequate social support and report more depression, anxiety, somatization, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on standardized tests. No differences were found in the health status of the infants of women who experienced violence compared to those who did not.                  Conclusions:                    Clinicians should sensitively ask recent migrant women (asylum seekers, refugees, and nonrefugee immigrants) about violence associated with pregnancy and appropriately assess, treat, and refer them.

Folic acid,"Exploring relationships among psychosocial status, dietary quality, and measures of placental development during the first trimester in low-income women - PubMed","        Purpose:                    To examine the relationships between maternal psychosocial factors and dietary quality and explore the relationships among dietary quality and selected biomarkers of nutrition and placental development.                  Method:                    A cross-sectional design in 18 low-income, pregnant women.                  Results:                    Partner support was positively related to vegetable intake (r = .54) and negatively related to intake of iron (r = -.68) and grains (r = -.67). Emotional eating in response to anger was negatively related to intake of iron-(r /it> = -.53) and folate-rich (r = -.75) foods, and emotional eating in response to anxiety was negatively related to intake of folate-rich foods (r = -.51). Depressed women had an increased intake of calcium-rich foods (r = .60). Levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were negatively related to depression (r = -.56) and intake of foods high in calcium (r = -.53) and iron (r = -.34) but positively related to serum calcium levels (r = .60). VEGF was negatively relationship to soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1; r = -.56). Placental growth factor had a negative relationship with maternal serum levels of albumin (r = -.61) and calcium (r = -.65).                  Conclusions:                    Low-income pregnant women who eat to cope with anger and anxiety may have an inadequate intake of nutrients that contribute to positive pregnancy outcomes. Placental development in the early weeks of pregnancy may be influenced by maternal psychosocial and nutritional status. More research is needed to explore the relationship of dietary quality and placental development in the first trimester of pregnancy.          "
Folic acid,"Emotional distress and quality of life during folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin in colorectal cancer patients with and without chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: A cross-sectional study - PubMed","              When the 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) chemotherapy regimen is used to treat colorectal cancer (CRC), chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) caused by oxaliplatin can substantially affect quality of life (QOL) in the CRC patients. This study compared emotional distress and QOL during FOLFOX in CRC patients with and without CIPN symptoms.This cross-sectional, descriptive, and comparative study recruited 68 CRC patients receiving FOLFOX at a local teaching hospital and at a medical center in southern Taiwan. Self-reported structured questionnaires (oxaliplatin-associated neuropathy questionnaire, profile of mood states short form, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, Core 30, version 3.0) were used for 1-time data collection. The Chi-square test, Fisher exact test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to analyze data, and a P-value < .05 was considered statistically significant.The CIPN group had 45 (66.2%) patients, and the non-CIPN group had 23 (33.8%) patients. The 5 most common symptoms were coldness-related burning sensation or discomfort in the upper limbs, numbness in the upper limbs, tingling in the upper limbs, impairment of vision, and discomfort in the throat. The CIPN group had more females (P = .013), a more advanced stage of CRC (P = .04) and a higher chemotherapy dosage (P = .006). The 2 groups did not significantly differ in anxiety (P = .065) or depression (P = .135). Compared to the non-CIPN group, the CIPN group had significantly lower functioning (P = .001) and global health status (P < .001) and significantly more symptoms (P < .001).The CIPN group had significantly lower QOL compared to the non-CIPN group. However, the CIPN group did not have lower emotional distress compared to the non-CIPN group. The results of this study demonstrate the need for in-service courses specifically designed to train health professionals in assessing and managing CIPN symptoms to improve QOL in CRC patients receiving FOLFOX.

Folic acid,Post-weaning folate deficiency induces a depression-like state via neuronal immaturity of the dentate gyrus in mice - PubMed,"              Folate deficiency has been suggested as a risk factor for depression in preclinical and clinical studies. Several hypotheses of mechanisms underlying folate deficiency-induced depressive symptoms have been proposed, but the detailed mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we assessed whether post-weaning folate deficiency affect neurological and psychological function. The low folate diet-fed mice showed depression-like behavior in the forced swim test. In contrast, spontaneous locomotor activity, social behavior, coordinated motor skills, anxiety-like behavior and spatial memory did not differ between control and low folate diet-fed mice. In the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, decreased number of newborn mature neurons and increased number of immature neurons were observed in low folate diet-fed mice. Staining with Golgi-Cox method revealed that dendritic complexity, spine density and the number of mature spines of neurons were markedly reduced in the DG of low folate diet-fed mice. Stress response of neurons indicated as c-Fos expression was also reduced in the DG of low folate diet-fed mice. These results suggest that reduction in the degree of maturation of newborn hippocampal neurons underlies folate deficiency-induced depressive symptoms.          "
Folic acid,Fluoxetine treatment for anxiety in women undergoing in vitro fertilization - PubMed,"        Objective:                    To compare anxiety levels experienced during 4 stressful periods of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and treatment outcomes between women taking fluoxetine and a placebo.                  Methods:                    A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of patients allocated to receive either fluoxetine (FLX) or folic acid (FA). Anxiety state was assessed at the beginning of ovarian stimulation (OS), ovum pick-up, embryo transfer, and on the day of the pregnancy test (DPT) using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).                  Results:                    Baseline STAI-S and STAI-T were normal. From OS to DPT, STAI-S increased from 42.8+/-10.6 to 44+/-9.0 in the FLX group and from 40.9+/-8.1 to 45.3+/-8.3 in the FA group (P=0.03 and P=0.001, respectively). IVF outcome was not affected by the treatment in the two groups.                  Conclusions:                    Caution is needed in prescribing fluoxetine to alleviate anxiety in patients undergoing IVF. Studies are needed to determine whether other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or higher fluoxetine doses can relieve emotional distress without affecting IVF outcome.          "
Folic acid,The role of pharmacoepidemiology in pharmacovigilance: rational drug use in pregnancy - PubMed,"              The most important objective of the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance of Congenital Abnormalities is the postmarketing surveillance of the teratogenic effects of drugs. This dataset includes 22,865 pregnant women who had offspring with congenital abnormalities and 38,151 pregnant women who had healthy babies between 1980 and 1996. Their case-control analysis is appropriate to assess the risks and benefits of drug treatments during pregnancy. Of about 4000 drugs used in Hungary, 35 seemed to be human teratogens. Only a small proportion (about 1%) of congenital abnormalities is traceable to teratogenic drugs in humans. Hungarian studies were not able to confirm the teratogenicity of tetracyclines (doxycycline) and some other drugs, but indicated the beneficial effect of clotrimazole in the prevention of undescended testis related to preterm birth. Periconceptional multivitamin/folic acid supplementation can reduce the first occurrence of neural-tube defects, oral clefts, cardiovascular malformations, and urinary tract defects. At present the teratogenicity of drugs is exaggerated and the benefits of drug treatment during pregnancy are underestimated. This unbalanced risk-benefit assessment initiated disadvantageous decisions, e.g. planned pregnancies are terminated because of the supposed false teratogenic risk of drugs; pregnant women with acute or chronic diseases are not treated adequately and it causes exacerbation of the illness or fetal complications; the necessary drug treatments are connected with a permanent psychological stress. In conclusion, the anxiety and fear created by the notion that nearly all drugs cause congenital abnormalities is more harmful than the effect of proven human teratogenic drugs themselves.

Folic acid,A systematic review of the associations between maternal nutritional biomarkers and depression and/or anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum - PubMed,"        Background:                    Nutritional requirements need to be met in order to adapt to pre- and postnatal changes. Our aim was to systematically review the evidence of associations between nutritional biomarkers and psychological distress during pregnancy and in the first postnatal year.                  Methods:                    MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Scielo, LILACS, clinicaltrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched for articles from inception to 4/15/2016. Studies of maternal nutritional biomarkers in blood (fatty acids/micronutrients/amino acids) and associations with psychological distress (depression/anxiety/stress) were included. Two independent reviewers extracted data based on study designs, participants, outcomes, exposures, and association measures.                  Results:                    Thirty-eight studies were included. A total of 13 studies showed divergent or no associations between serum/plasma/erythrocyte fatty acid concentrations and depression/anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum. Changes in serum cholesterol levels from pregnancy to postpartum showed a significant inverse correlation with depression in one out of three studies. Five out of seven studies found an inverse association between serum vitamin D levels and pre- and postnatal depression. Plasma tryptophan levels were inversely correlated with postnatal depression scores in three out of four studies. We identified that one out of two studies presented no significant association between vitamin B12/folate/ferritin concentrations and depression in postpartum.                  Limitations:                    There was higher variability between association measures, time and scales of depression and anxiety assessments.                  Conclusions:                    The majority of high-quality studies suggest that lower vitamin D levels may be associated with postpartum depression. However, further evidence is needed for guiding clinical practice on nutritional biomarkers.          "
Ginkgo biloba,One water-soluble polysaccharide from Ginkgo biloba leaves with antidepressant activities via modulation of the gut microbiome - PubMed,"              Depression, a mental illness characterized by persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest, has been a serious health problem worldwide. Manipulation of the microbiota by probiotics and prebiotics represents a novel emerging strategy for the treatment of various psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorders. Here, we show that one water-soluble polysaccharide from Ginkgo biloba leaves (GPS) reduced stress-induced depression and reversed gut dysbiosis. Similar to the antidepressant paroxetine, GPS significantly reduced the immobility times in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST) and anxiety-like behavior in the open field test (OFT). Consistent with the improvement of depression-like behavior above, GPS mice had elevated serotonin and dopamine levels in multiple brain regions including the hippocampus, cerebral cortex and olfactory bulb, relative to unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) treatment mice. GPS treatment could alleviate the stress-induced reduction in the density of serotonin-positive and dopamine-positive cells. Fecal microbiome transplant (FMT) combined with antibiotic treatment showed that the anti-depressant activity of GPS had a causal relationship with intestinal microbes. By performing a pyrosequencing-based analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA (V3 + V4 region) in fecal of the mice, the results showed that GPS reversed depression-associated gut dysbiosis and increased the richness of Lactobacillus species which has been proven to be a path to relieve depression. Our results demonstrated that the polysaccharide from Ginkgo biloba leaves might be a promising pharmacotherapeutic candidate for treating depression.          "
Ginkgo biloba,The effects of Ginkgo biloba extract on cognitive functions in aged female rats: the role of oxidative stress and brain-derived neurotrophic factor - PubMed,"              The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) on cognitive functions as well as oxidative stress and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in aged female rats. Rats were divided into 4 groups according to age (young vs. aged) and treatment (GBE vs. vehicle). GBE or vehicle was given for 30 d, and a series of behavioral tests were performed. Following behavioral testing, blood samples and brain tissues were obtained for analysis of BDNF, malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and glutathione levels, and superoxide dismutase activity. Locomotor activity and anxiety levels were lower in the aged rats. Based on Morris water maze probe trial findings, GBE supplementation increased the number of platform crossings in the aged rats. MDA and 8-OHdG levels were lower in the brain tissue, and BDNF levels were higher in plasma in the rates treated with GBE. Based on these findings, we concluded that GBE supplementation improved cognitive functions by decreasing oxidative damage and increasing the BDNF level in aged female rats.          "
Ginkgo biloba,Ginkgo biloba extract: cognitive enhancer or antistress buffer - PubMed,"              Constituents extracted from the leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree possess beneficial properties that may buffer the aging nervous system from deterioration due to oxidative stress. In the present investigation, a standardized extract of G. biloba (EGb 761) or an equal volume of the vehicle was administered (100 mg/kg/day) to senescent (20-month) C57BL/6 male mice for up to 82 consecutive days. Animals were tested twice in the Morris water maze (MWM) after 28 and 70 days of treatment. No differences were observed in acquisition or retention of performance on the water maze. Elevated-plus maze (EPM) trials were conducted prior to and subsequent to the chronic treatment regimen. Marked baseline differences in plus-maze performance were present in the first experiment. A second experiment used a matched-pairs design to minimize preexisting differences. Results supported the hypothesis that EGb 761 may serve as an antistress buffer, attenuating the increase in anxiety typically observed in animals after cold water exposure. Tissue samples from the hippocampus and cortex were analyzed by Western blot for the transcription factor cyclic-AMP response element binding (CREB) protein. EGb 761 had no significant effect on immunoreactivity to CREB from either the hippocampus or the cerebral cortex.          "
Ginkgo biloba,"Plant-based medicines for anxiety disorders, part 2: a review of clinical studies with supporting preclinical evidence - PubMed","              Research in the area of herbal psychopharmacology has revealed a variety of promising medicines that may provide benefit in the treatment of general anxiety and specific anxiety disorders. However, a comprehensive review of plant-based anxiolytics has been absent to date. Thus, our aim was to provide a comprehensive narrative review of plant-based medicines that have clinical and/or preclinical evidence of anxiolytic activity. We present the article in two parts. In part one, we reviewed herbal medicines for which only preclinical investigations for anxiolytic activity have been performed. In this current article (part two), we review herbal medicines for which there have been both preclinical and clinical investigations of anxiolytic activity. A search of MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, Scopus and the Cochrane Library databases was conducted (up to 28 October 2012) for English language papers using the search terms 'anxiety' OR 'anxiety disorder' OR 'generalized anxiety disorder' OR 'social phobia' OR 'post-traumatic stress disorder' OR 'panic disorder' OR 'agoraphobia' OR 'obsessive compulsive disorder' in combination with the search terms 'Herb*' OR 'Medicinal Plants' OR 'Botanical Medicine' OR 'Chinese herb*', in addition to individual herbal medicines. This search of the literature revealed 1,525 papers, of which 53 plants were included in the review (having at least one study using the whole plant extract). Of these plants, 21 had human clinical trial evidence (reviewed here in part two), with the other 32 having solely preclinical evidence (reviewed in part one). Support for efficacy was found for chronic use (i.e. greater than one day) of the following herbs in treating a range of anxiety disorders in human clinical trials: Piper methysticum, Matricaria recutita, Ginkgo biloba, Scutellaria lateriflora, Silybum marianum, Passiflora incarnata, Withania somniferum, Galphimia glauca, Centella asiatica, Rhodiola rosea, Echinacea spp., Melissa officinalis and Echium amoenum. For several of the plants studied, conclusions need to be tempered due to methodological issues such as small sample sizes, brief intervention durations and non-replication. Current evidence does not support Hypericum perforatum or Valeriana spp. for any anxiety disorder. Acute anxiolytic activity was found for Centella asiatica, Salvia spp., Melissa officinalis, Passiflora incarnata and Citrus aurantium. Bacopa monnieri has shown anxiolytic effects in people with cognitive decline. The therapeutic application of psychotropic plant-based treatments for anxiety disorders is also discussed, specifically Psychotria viridis and Banisteriopsis caarti (ayahuasca), Psilocybe spp. and cannabidiol-enriched (low tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC)) Cannabis spp.          "
Ginkgo biloba,Ginkgo biloba as an Alternative Medicine in the Treatment of Anxiety in Dementia and other Psychiatric Disorders - PubMed,"        Background:                    Mental disorders are the most common health problems in the worldwide population. Current medicines against these conditions have undesired side effects or limited effectiveness. These disadvantageous pharmacological and therapeutic characteristics provoke a low adherence to treatment in an important percentage of patients with mental disorders. Since ancient times, ethnically different groups have been using plants extracts as medicines for the treatment of mental conditions including dementia, depression and anxiety disorders. Among them are extracts of Ginkgo biloba, a tree in the division Gingophyta, that has been used by millions of people worldwide.                  Objective:                    This review aims to discuss current scientific evidence of efficacy, neuroprotective and antioxidant effects as mechanism of action, side effects and potential interaction with other commonly prescribed anxiolytic drugs.                  Methods:                    A PubMed search of preclinical studies as well as individual clinical trials and meta-analysis were scrutinized.                  Results:                    Various preclinical and clinical studies have shown a positive effect of Ginkgo biloba to improve cognitive abilities in impaired individuals and reducing anxiety under pathological conditions.                  Conclusion:                    A more advanced clinical research is needed to confirm the efficacy of Gingko biloba for the treatment of anxiety in different health conditions.          "
Ginkgo biloba,Gingko biloba extract diminishes stress-induced memory deficits in rats - PubMed,"              Exposure to chronic restraint stress in rats and psychosocial stress in humans has been shown to alter cognitive functions such as learning and memory and has been linked to the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety disorders. Antianxiety or sedative agents used in the management of stress have several disadvantages and undesired effects. Therefore, in this study, we investigated efficacy of a natural medicine, the extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGB 761), in prevention and treatment of the post-stress memory dysfunctions. The results showed that chronic restraint stress (2 h for 21 days) or an 'equivalent' dose of exogenous corticosterone (5 mg/kg) impaired nonspatial memory as measured by an object recognition test. In control rats, EGB 761 improved spatial and nonspatial memory in Morris water maze and object recognition tests. Preventive doses of EGB 761 (100 mg/kg) normalized cognitive deficits, seen in rats chronically stressed or treated with corticosterone in object recognition test, and improved memory processes in these rats measured by Morris water maze test. There was no influence of our treatments on locomotor exploratory activity and anxiety measured in open field and elevated 'plus' maze tests, making a contribution of unspecific motor and emotional effects of the used drugs to their performance in the memory tests improbable.

Ginkgo biloba,Use of complementary therapies in patients with cardiovascular disease - PubMed,"              Previous studies have suggested that patients with chronic medical conditions use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) at a higher rate than the general population. Despite recent interest in CAM for cardiovascular disease, few data are available regarding patterns of use in patients with cardiovascular disease in the United States. This study used the 2002 National Health Interview Survey and analyzed data on CAM use in 10,572 respondents with cardiovascular disease. Among those with cardiovascular disease, 36% had used CAM (excluding prayer) in the previous 12 months. The most commonly used therapies were herbal products (18%) and mind-body therapies (17%). Among herbs, echinacea, garlic, ginseng, ginkgo biloba, and glucosamine with or without chondroitin were most commonly used. Among mind-body therapies, deep-breathing exercises and meditation were most commonly used. Overall, CAM was used most frequently for musculoskeletal complaints (24% of respondents who used mind-body therapies, 22% who used herbs, 45% who used any CAM). Mind-body therapies were also used for anxiety or depression (23%) and stress or emotional health and wellness (16%). Herbs were commonly used for head and chest colds (22%). Fewer respondents (10%) used CAM specifically for their cardiovascular conditions (5% for hypertension, 2% for coronary disease, 3% for vascular insufficiency, < 1% for heart failure or stroke). Most, however, who used CAM for their cardiovascular condition perceived the therapies to be helpful (80% for herbs, 94% for mind-body therapies). CAM use was more common in younger respondents, women, Asians, and those with more education and greater incomes. In conclusion, CAM use, particularly herbs and mind-body therapies, is common in the United States in patients with cardiovascular disease and mirrors use in the general population. CAM use specifically to treat cardiovascular conditions, however, is less common.          "
Ginkgo biloba,[Participation of pineal gland in antistressor activity of adaptogenic drugs] - PubMed,"              Chronic stress produces some morphological changes in rats, including thymus weight reduction, adrenal hypertrophy, and peptic ulcers in stomach. Repeated administration of phytoadaptogenic drugs (ginseng and bilobil) decreased these stress-induced disorders. The antistressor activity of drugs was attenuated upon by removal of the pineal gland. Histochemical and morphometric investigation of pineal tissues in stressed animals showed that that the pharmacological effect was accompanied by increasing functional activity of the pineal gland. It is suggested that pineal mobilization may participate in antistressor activity of phytoadaptogenic drugs.          "
Ginkgo biloba,Blood pressure and heart rate of students undergoing a medical licensing examination - PubMed,"        Aims:                    To assess the effect of a real life mental stress situation on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) in students undergoing a medical licensing examination.                  Method:                    Prospective observational study of 121 medical students taking the final licensing exam. BP and HR were taken before and after the exam. Additionally, BP was measured by ambulatory BP monitoring device and HR was recorded continuously by an HR monitor belt in 25 students throughout the examination.                  Major findings:                    Diastolic BP (DBP) increased from 81 +/- 10 mmHg before the exam to 86 +/- 9 mmHg (p = 0.008) during the exam and to 88 +/- 11 mmHg, (p = 0.007) 15 min after the exam. Systolic BP (SBP) did not increase significantly during (from 131 +/- 14 before the exam to 136 +/- 18 mmHg) and after the exam (135 +/- 16 mmHg). HR decreased during (to 100 +/- 18 beats/min, p < 0.001), and after the exam (to 95 +/- 19 beats/min, p < 0.001) compared to values before the exam (114 +/- 19 beats/min). SBP was higher in male students compared to female students before (138 +/- 10 vs 125 +/- 18 mmHg) and after (126 +/- 18 vs 115 +/- 17 mmHg) the exam (p < 0.01).                  Conclusion:                    Only DBP increased during medical licensing examination, albeit within a small range. SBP did not change significantly and HR decreased during the exam. Male students showed a higher SBP compared to female students.          "
Ginkgo biloba,Extracts from Eleutherococcus senticosus (Rupr. et Maxim.) Maxim. Roots: A New Hope Against Honeybee Death Caused by Nosemosis - PubMed,"              Pollinators, the cornerstones of our terrestrial ecosystem, have been at the very core of our anxiety. This is because we can nowadays observe a dangerous decline in the number of insects. With the numbers of pollinators dramatically declining worldwide, the scientific community has been growing more and more concerned about the future of insects as fundamental elements of most terrestrial ecosystems. Trying to address this issue, we looked for substances that might increase bee resistance. To this end, we checked the effects of plant-based adaptogens on honeybees in laboratory tests and during field studies on 30 honeybee colonies during two seasons. In this study, we have tested extracts obtained from: Eleutherococcus senticosus, Garcinia cambogia, Panax ginseng, Ginkgo biloba, Schisandra chinensis, and Camellia sinensis. The 75% ethanol E. senticosus root extract proved to be the most effective, both as a cure and in the prophylaxis of nosemosis. Therefore, Eleutherococcus senticosus, and its active compounds, eleutherosides, are considered the most powerful adaptogens, in the pool of all extracts that were selected for screening, for supporting immunity and improving resistance of honeybees. The optimum effective concentration of 0.4 mg/mL E. senticosus extract responded to c.a. 5.76, 2.56 and 0.07 µg/mL of eleutheroside B, eleutheroside E and naringenin, respectively. The effect of E. senticosus extracts on honeybees involved a similar adaptogenic response as on other animals, including humans. In this research, we show for the first time such an adaptogenic impact on invertebrates, i.e., the effect on honeybees stressed by nosemosis. We additionally hypothesised that these adaptogenic properties were connected with eleutherosides-secondary metabolites found exclusively in the Eleutherococcus genus and undetected in other studied extracts. As was indicated in this study, eleutherosides are very stable chemically and can be found in extracts in similar amounts even after two years from extraction. Considering the role bees play in nature, we may conclude that demonstrating the adaptogenic properties which plant extracts have in insects is the most significant finding resulting from this research. This knowledge might bring to fruition numerous economic and ecological benefits.          "
Ginkgo biloba,"Efficacy of Cognition Support Formula® on cognitive function in older adults with subjective cognitive impairment: a protocol for a 26-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial - PubMed","        Background:                    Due to an ageing population in Australia there has been an increase in the number of older adults with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), a self-reported decline in cognitive function associated with an increased risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. There is no current, recommended treatment for SCI; therefore, the effectiveness of a supplement approved by the Therapeutic Goods Association that has the potential to enhance cognitive function in an at-risk cohort should be tested. The primary aim of this proposed research is to determine the efficacy of 6 months of treatment with BioCeuticals Cognition Support Formula® (containing Bacopa monniera (brahmi), Ginkgo biloba, Panax ginseng and alpha-lipoic acid) on cognition in older adults with SCI (utilising the CogState® one card learning and identification tests as co-primary outcome measures of visual short-term memory and attention; mean speed (ms), accuracy (%), and total number of hits, misses, and anticipations) compared with placebo. The secondary aims are to assess an improvement in other cognitive domains (executive functioning, processing speed, and working memory), evaluate safety, adverse effects, and determine efficacy on mood, fatigue, and neurocognition. It is expected that improvements across the study timepoints in the co-primary outcomes in the active treatment group (compared with placebo) will be evident.                  Method:                    One-hundred and twenty participants will be recruited for the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups (active or placebo) at a 1:1 ratio, and will be required to complete a series of cognitive (using CogState®), mood (using the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-42) and Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI)), and fatigue (using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F)) tasks at baseline (0 months), the midpoint (3 months), and the endpoint (6 months). These tasks will be evaluated between timepoints (baseline vs. midpoint, midpoint vs. endpoint, and baseline vs. endpoint). Neurocognition will be measured by electroencephalography at baseline and at the endpoint in half of the participants. Adverse effects will be documented over the 6-month trial period.                  Discussion:                    This is the first study to test the efficacy of Cognition Support Formula® on cognition in older adults with SCI. As people with SCI have an increased risk of dementia, and there are limited treatments options for this population, it is important to assess a supplement that has the potential to enhance cognitive function.

Ginkgo biloba,Ginkgo biloba normalizes stress- and corticosterone-induced impairment of recall in rats - PubMed,"              Exposure to chronic restraint stress in rats and psychosocial stress in humans has been shown to alter cognitive functions such as learning and memory and has been linked to the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety disorders. Antianxiety or sedative agents used in the management of stress have several disadvantages and side effects. Therefore, in this study, we investigated efficacy of a natural medicine, the extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGB 761), in prevention and treatment of the post-stress memory dysfunctions. The results showed that chronic restraint stress (2h for 21 days) or an 'equivalent' dose of exogenous corticosterone (5 mg kg(-1)) decreased re-entry latencies in the passive avoidance situation showing thus impairment of recall. Preventive doses of EGB 761 (100 mg kg(-1)), given 30 min before each restraint stress episode or corticosterone injection, abolished cognitive deficits seen in unprotected rats. There was no influence of stress, corticosterone, and EGB 761 on the acquisition of conditioned avoidance responses (CARs).          "
Ginkgo biloba,Protective effects of chronic treatment with a standardized extract of Ginkgo biloba L. in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus of middle-aged rats - PubMed,"              This study assessed the effects of chronic treatment with a standardized extract of Ginkgo biloba L. (EGb) on short-term and long-term memory as well as on anxiety-like and locomotor activity using the plus-maze discriminative avoidance task (PM-DAT). Additionally, we evaluated the antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of EGb on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsal hippocampus (DH) of middle-aged rats using the comet assay. Twelve-month-old male Wistar rats were administered vehicle or EGb (0.5mgkg(-1) or 1.0gkg(-1)) for 30days. Behavioural data showed that EGb treatment improved short-term memory. Neither an anti-anxiety effect nor a change in locomotor activity was observed. Twenty-four hours after the behavioural tests, the rats were decapitated, and the PFC and DH were quickly dissected out and prepared for the comet assay. The levels of DNA damage in the PFC were significantly lower in rats that were treated with 1.0gkg(-1) EGb. Both doses of EGb decreased H2O2-induced DNA breakage in cortical cells, whereas the levels of DNA damage in the EGb-treated animals were significantly lower than those in the control animals. No significant differences in the level of DNA damage in hippocampal cells were observed among the experimental groups. EGb treatment was not able to reduce H2O2-induced DNA damage in hippocampal cells. Altogether, our data provide the first demonstration that chronic EGb treatment improved the short-term memory of middle-aged rats, an effect that could be associated with a reduction in free radical production in the PFC. These data suggest that EGb treatment might increase the survival of cortical neurons and corroborate and extend the view that EGb has protective and therapeutic properties.          "
Ginkgo biloba,GABA-modulating phytomedicines for anxiety: A systematic review of preclinical and clinical evidence - PubMed,"              Anxiety disorders are chronic and functionally disabling conditions with high psychological stress, characterised by cognitive symptoms of excessive worry and focus difficulties and physiological symptoms such as muscle tension and insomnia. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter within the central nervous system and is a key target of pharmacotherapies in the treatment of anxiety. Although current pharmaceutical treatments are often efficacious, they may cause undesirable side effects including cognitive decrements and withdrawal symptoms. Plant-based ""phytomedicines"" may provide novel treatment options, to act as an adjunctive or alternative to existing anxiolytic medications. As such, we conducted a systematic review to assess the current body of literature on anxiolytic phytomedicines and/or phytoconstituents. An open-ended search to 5 July 2017 was conducted using MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, and Cochrane library online databases and performed in a stepped format from preclinical to clinical investigations. Eligible studies must have had (a) in vitro evidence of GABA-modulating activity, (b) animal studies using anxiety models to test an anxiolytic effect, and (c) human clinical trials. Ten phytomedicines were identified as having preclinical investigations showing interaction with the GABA system, in addition to human clinical trials: kava, valerian, pennywort, hops, chamomile, Ginkgo biloba, passionflower, ashwagandha, skullcap, and lemon balm. Collectively, the literature reveals preclinical and clinical evidence for various phytomedicines modulating GABA-pathways, with comparative anxiolytic effect to the current array of pharmaceuticals, along with good safety and tolerability profiles.

Ginkgo biloba,Preventive action of Ginkgo biloba in stress- and corticosterone-induced impairment of spatial memory in rats - PubMed,"              In this study, we tested preventive effects of a natural medicine the extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGB 761) on post-stress cognitive dysfunction. Exposure to chronic restraint stress in rats and psychosocial stress in humans has been shown to alter cognitive functions such as learning and memory and have been linked to the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety disorders. Our findings indicate that chronic restraint stress impaired egocentric spatial memory as observed in the eight-arm radial maze but it did not alter the allocentric spatial memory in the Morris water maze. In control rats EGB 761 (100mg/kg, orally) improved spatial memory in these two tests. Also, EGB 761 normalized cognitive deficits seen in rats chronically stressed or treated with an 'equivalent' dose of exogenous corticosterone (5mg/kg, subcutaneously). We conclude that, in rats, repeated administration of EGB 761 prevents stress- and corticosterone-induced impairments of spatial memory.          "
Ginkgo biloba,Stress Recovery of Campus Street Trees as Visual Stimuli on Graduate Students in Autumn - PubMed,"              Human stress recovery response to landscapes is under discussion in Chinese settings. The present study aimed to clarify the stress recovery effects of campus street trees on graduate students in autumn. A total of 150 participants (23.75 ± 1.01 years old) completed the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and were then randomly assigned to view one of five virtual environments, including the street trees Sophora japonica, Ginkgo biloba, Platanus acerifolia, Koelreuteria paniculata, and the indoor environment (control). Physiological responses were measured by R-R interval and electroencephalography (EEG). Psychological responses were examined through the state version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) and the Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS). Results showed that R-R intervals significantly increased while viewing all street trees. Both alpha and beta brainwave activities while viewing S. japonica and G. biloba were remarkably higher than those while viewing P. acerifolia and K. paniculata. The STAI-S scores significantly decreased, and the positive PRS scores were registered after viewing street trees. We concluded that a brief virtual visual experience of campus street trees in autumn has stress recovery effects on graduate students, and the different levels of stress recovery are associated with different types of street trees.

Ginseng (Siberian),The effects of a standardized Acanthopanax koreanum extract on stress-induced behavioral alterations in mice - PubMed,"        Ethnopharmacological relevance:                    The roots and stem bark of Acanthopanax koreanum Nakai (Araliaceae), a well-known herbal medicine in Jeju Island, Korea, has been used as a tonic agent in treating stress-related states. Despite its popular application, the anti-anxiety or anti-depressive action of Acanthopanax koreanum is not yet known.                  Aim of the study:                    This study aimed to determine the effects of Acanthopanax koreanum on stress-induced behavioral alterations such as anxiety and depression.                  Materials and methods:                    Mice in the acute stress group were exposed to immobilization stress for 2h followed by electric foot shocks (0.5 mA in 1 s duration with a 10 s inter-shock interval) for 2 min, while sub-chronically stressed mice were exposed to these stresses for 2 weeks, once per day. 70% ethanolic extract of Acanthopanax koreanum (EEAK) (25, 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg) was administered once or sub-chronically (for 2 weeks) 1h prior to stress induction. Anxiety- or depression-like behavioral changes were evaluated using the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test and the forced swimming test (FST) a day after the final stress induction. Corticosterone levels and spleen weight were measured after conducting all the behavioral assays. The numbers of BrdU- or DCX-immunopositive cells in the hippocampal region of sub-chronically stressed mice were measured 2 days after EEAK treatment.                  Results:                    The percentage of time spent in the open arms was decreased in both the acutely and chronically stressed mice. In the FST, the immobility time was increased by only chronic stress, but not by acute stress. Acute or sub-chronic administration of EEAK significantly prevented the anxiety- or depression-like behavioral changes caused by stress. EEAK also attenuated stress-induced decrease and increase of spleen weight and corticosterone levels, respectively. Furthermore, the sub-chronic administration of EEAK (100 or 200 mg/kg, for 2 weeks) increased the number of BrdU-, doublecortin-, and neuropeptide Y-positive cells in the hippocampal region of the sub-chronically stressed mice.                  Conclusion:                    EEAK attenuated the behavioral and biochemical changes in acute or sub-chronic stressed mice. These results suggest the therapeutic potential of Acanthopanax koreanum for the treatment of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders including anxiety disorders or major depressive disorder.

Ginseng (Siberian),Anxiolytic Effects of Acanthopanax senticosus HARMS Occur via Regulation of Autonomic Function and Activate Hippocampal BDNF⁻TrkB Signaling - PubMed,"              Mental stress, such as anxiety and conflict, causes physiological changes, such as changes in autonomic nervous activity and gastric ulcers. In addition, stress induces glucocorticoids and changes the hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression levels. We previously reported that Acanthopanax senticosus HARM (ASH) prevents stress-induced gastric ulcers. Thus, we investigated the potential anxiolytic effect and influence of ASH on the hippocampus BDNF-related protein in male Sprague-Dawley rats fed 1% and 5% ASH extract-containing food for one week using novelty suppressed feeding (NSF) and improved elevated beam walking (IEBW) tests. ASH treatment significantly decreased latency to eat in the NSF test and increased the time spent on the open arm in the IEBW test. ASH5% treatment showed a significant decrease in LFnu, indicative of sympathetic nervous activity, and a significant increase in HFnu, indicative of parasympathetic nervous activity, in the NSF test. In addition, ASH1% and ASH5% treatments significantly decreased LFnu and significantly increased HFnu in the IEBW test. ASH5% treatment significantly increased hippocampal BDNF protein expression in both Western blotting and immunohistochemistry experiments. Our findings suggest that anxiolytic effects of ASH occur via the regulation of autonomic function and increased hippocampal BDNF signaling.          "
Ginseng (Siberian),Extracts from Eleutherococcus senticosus (Rupr. et Maxim.) Maxim. Roots: A New Hope Against Honeybee Death Caused by Nosemosis - PubMed,"              Pollinators, the cornerstones of our terrestrial ecosystem, have been at the very core of our anxiety. This is because we can nowadays observe a dangerous decline in the number of insects. With the numbers of pollinators dramatically declining worldwide, the scientific community has been growing more and more concerned about the future of insects as fundamental elements of most terrestrial ecosystems. Trying to address this issue, we looked for substances that might increase bee resistance. To this end, we checked the effects of plant-based adaptogens on honeybees in laboratory tests and during field studies on 30 honeybee colonies during two seasons. In this study, we have tested extracts obtained from: Eleutherococcus senticosus, Garcinia cambogia, Panax ginseng, Ginkgo biloba, Schisandra chinensis, and Camellia sinensis. The 75% ethanol E. senticosus root extract proved to be the most effective, both as a cure and in the prophylaxis of nosemosis. Therefore, Eleutherococcus senticosus, and its active compounds, eleutherosides, are considered the most powerful adaptogens, in the pool of all extracts that were selected for screening, for supporting immunity and improving resistance of honeybees. The optimum effective concentration of 0.4 mg/mL E. senticosus extract responded to c.a. 5.76, 2.56 and 0.07 µg/mL of eleutheroside B, eleutheroside E and naringenin, respectively. The effect of E. senticosus extracts on honeybees involved a similar adaptogenic response as on other animals, including humans. In this research, we show for the first time such an adaptogenic impact on invertebrates, i.e., the effect on honeybees stressed by nosemosis. We additionally hypothesised that these adaptogenic properties were connected with eleutherosides-secondary metabolites found exclusively in the Eleutherococcus genus and undetected in other studied extracts. As was indicated in this study, eleutherosides are very stable chemically and can be found in extracts in similar amounts even after two years from extraction. Considering the role bees play in nature, we may conclude that demonstrating the adaptogenic properties which plant extracts have in insects is the most significant finding resulting from this research. This knowledge might bring to fruition numerous economic and ecological benefits.          "
Ginseng (Siberian),Puerariae Radix Prevents Anxiety and Cognitive Deficits in Mice Under Oligomeric Aβ-Induced Stress - PubMed,"              To evaluate the therapeutic effects of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for Alzheimer's disease (AD), we evaluated five CHMs in oligomeric Aβ25-35-treated mouse primary hippocampal neuronal cultures. The aqueous extract from the root of Pueraria lobata (Puerariae Radix; PR) showed better neuroprotective effects than did the other four CHM aqueous extracts, including Gardenia jasminoides, Eleutherococcus senticosus, Rhodiola rosea, and Panax, in the primary culture treated with saline or oligomeric Aβ25-35. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effects of aqueous extract of PR were also better than its well-known active compound, puerarin, against the neurotoxicity of oligomeric Aβ25-35 in a primary culture. For in vivo experiments, C57BL/6J male mice that received direct infusion of soluble oligomeric Aβ25-35 into the bilateral hippocampal CA1 subregion were used as an alternative AD mouse model. The effects and molecular mechanisms of chronic systemic administration of PR aqueous extract were evaluated in the alternative AD model. PR aqueous extract prevented anxiety and cognitive impairment in mice associated with a decrease in the levels of Aβ deposition, tau protein phosphorylation, inflammation, loss of noradrenergic, and serotonergic neurons and an increase in the levels of synaptophysin and insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) against the toxicity of oligomeric Aβ25-35. Furthermore, no obvious damage to the liver and kidney was detected after chronic systemic administration of PR aqueous extract. Therefore, using PR could be a safer, more effective therapeutic strategy than using its active compound puerarin to prevent both cognitive and noncognitive dysfunction and related pathological features of AD.

Ginseng (Siberian),"Combined Treatment with Two Water Extracts of Eleutherococcus senticosus Leaf and Rhizome of Drynaria fortunei Enhances Cognitive Function: A Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, Double-Blind Study in Healthy Adults - PubMed","              We previously found that the water extract of Eleutherococcus senticosus leaves (ES extract) enhanced cognitive function in normal mice. Our study also revealed that the water extract of rhizomes of Drynaria fortunei (DR extract) enhanced memory function in Alzheimer's disease model mice. In addition, our previous experiments suggested that a combined treatment of ES and DR extracts synergistically improved memory and anti-stress response in mice. Although those two botanical extracts are expected to be beneficial for neuropsychological function, no clinical data has ever been reported. Therefore, we performed a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate cognitive enhancement and anti-stress effects by the intake of a combined extract in healthy volunteers. The intake period was 12 weeks. The Japanese version of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) test was used for neurocognitive assessment. The combined treatment of ES and DR extracts significantly increased the figure recall subscore of RBANS (p = 0.045) in an intergroup comparison. Potentiation of language domain ((p = 0.040), semantic fluency (p = 0.021) and figure recall (p = 0.052) was shown by the extracts (in intragroup comparison). In anti-stress response, the anxiety/uncertainly score was improved by the extract in an intragroup comparison (p = 0.022). No adverse effects were observed. The combined treatment of ES and DR extracts appear to safely enhance a part of cognitive function in healthy adults.          "
Magnolia Officinalis,Magnolol inhibits tumor necrosis factor-α-induced ICAM-1 expression via suppressing NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways in human lung epithelial cells - PubMed,"              Magnolol is a traditional Chinese medicine from the root and bark of Magnolia officinalis. It has long been used to treat anxiety, cough, headache and allergies, as well as a variety of inflammations. Lung inflammation is a key event in the pathogenesis of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The present study sought to examine the effects of magnolol on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in cultured human pulmonary epithelial cells, and adhesion of human macrophage-like U937 cells to A549 cells. A549 cells were incubated with magnolol at 25 and 50 μmol/l. Then, 20 ng/ml TNF-α was used to activate the cells. Magnolol inhibited the growth of human pulmonary epithelial A549 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Magnolol suppressed the adhesion of U937 cells to TNF-α-induced A549 cells. In cultured human pulmonary epithelial A549 cells, magnolol decreased TNF-α-induced upregulation of ICAM-1. Magnolol repressed TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in A549 cells by inhibiting phosphorylation of NF-κB, p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). These findings support the hypothesis that magnolol inhibits the inflammatory process in lung epithelial A549 cells by suppressing the ICAM-1 and NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. Taken together, these results indicate that magnolol offers significant potential as a therapeutic treatment for inflammatory diseases of the lungs including asthma, sepsis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Magnolia Officinalis,Evaluation of the psychometric properties of the PROMIS Cancer Fatigue Short Form with cancer patients - PubMed,"        Objective:                    Fatigue is common among cancer patients and adversely impacts quality of life. As such, it is important to measure fatigue accurately in a way that is not burdensome to patients. The 7-item Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Cancer Fatigue Short Form scale was recently developed using item response theory (IRT). The current study evaluated the psychometric properties of this scale in two samples of cancer patients using classical test theory (CTT).                  Methods:                    Two samples were used: 121 men with prostate cancer and 136 patients scheduled to undergo hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for hematologic cancer. All participants completed the PROMIS Cancer Fatigue Short Form as well as validated measures of fatigue, vitality, and depression. HCT patients also completed measures of anxiety, perceived stress, and a clinical interview designed to identify cases of cancer-related fatigue.                  Results:                    PROMIS Cancer Fatigue Short Form items loaded on a single factor (CFI=0.948) and the scale demonstrated good internal consistency reliability in both samples (Cronbach's alphas>0.86). Correlations with psychosocial measures were significant (p values<.0001) and in the expected direction, offering evidence for convergent and concurrent validity. PROMIS Fatigue scores were significantly higher in patients who met case definition criteria for cancer-related fatigue (p<.0001), demonstrating criterion validity.                  Conclusion:                    The current study provides evidence that the PROMIS Cancer Fatigue Short Form is a reliable and valid measure of fatigue in cancer patients.          "
Magnolia Officinalis,"Measurement of psychological factors associated with genetic testing for hereditary breast, ovarian and colon cancers - PubMed","              Despite numerous individual studies of psychological factors (depression, anxiety, distress) related to genetic testing for inherited cancer syndromes (CGT), there has been no systematic review of the psychological factors are measured among individuals at increased risk for hereditary breast, ovarian, or colon cancer. Our review provides an analysis of psychological factors in studies of CGT and discusses the instruments most commonly used to measure them. We performed a literature search using three major OVID databases from 1993 to January 2003. In the 19 studies that met our inclusion criteria, the most commonly assessed psychological factors were distress, anxiety, and depression. These factors were most often measured by the impact of event scale (IES), the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI), and the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies and Depression scale (CES-D), respectively. Our results show deficits in the existing body of literature on psychological factors associated with CGT including limited documentation of psychometrics and variability in instrumentation.

Magnolia Officinalis,[Effects of theanine and houpu extract in 7-day chick social separation-stress procedure] - PubMed,"        Objective:                    To examine the abilities of theanine and houpu extracts (HE) to reverse behavioral indexes (separation vocalization, stress-induced analgesia and activity).                  Method:                    7-day-old chicks received IP injection of theanine and HE 30 min before being tested in the presence of three social companions or in isolation for 3-min observation period. Dependent measures were: a) Chicks were placed into an infrared ray device to calculate their spontaneous activities by a computer program b) record the separation vocalizations for every chick. c) In the experiment of stress-induced analgesia, 50 uL of formalin (0.1%) was injected into the plantar of the animal foot to index stress-induced analgesia (i. e. foot-lift frequency, foot-lift duration and peck frequency).                  Result:                    In the experiments, isolated chicks exhibited more vocalizations (P < 0.01) and fewer pain-related behaviors than non-isolated chicks (P < 0.01). Theanine (12.5, 25, 50 mg x kg(-1)) and HE (25 mg x kg(-1)) decrease separately the tendency (dB) of the principal frequency (P < 0.05, P < 0.01); The stress induced analgesia can be reversed by theanine in 25, 50 mg x kg(-1). Both of the materials do not affect the spontaneous activities in this chick model without causing sedation.                  Conclusion:                    These results suggest that theanine and HE in the dosages may be useful in modulating anxiety states. They are seems no synergism in the chick model.          "
Magnolia Officinalis,"Honokiol, a neuroprotectant against mouse cerebral ischaemia, mediated by preserving Na+, K+-ATPase activity and mitochondrial functions - PubMed","              Honokiol, a component of the herb Magnolia officinalis, exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anxiolytic properties, increases seizure threshold, and promotes neurite outgrowth. Because stroke has become the second leading cause of death in industrialized countries, an effective neuroprotectant is urgently required. In this study, we attempted to elucidate in a mouse cerebral ischaemia model whether honokiol could be a neuroprotectant. Adult male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion for 45 min. Honokiol (10 microg/kg in 0.2 ml of saline) or control vehicle was intraperitoneally administered twice, 15 min. before and 60 min. after the induction of ischaemia. Cerebral ischaemia induced by this method was associated with an increase in synaptosomal production of reactive oxygen species, with decreases in synaptosomal mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) and synaptosomal mitochondrial metabolic function, and with reductions in Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activities of tissues isolated from selected brain regions. Administration of honokiol resulted in significant reductions in brain infarct volume and in synaptosomal production of reactive oxygen species. The decreases in synaptosomal mitochondrial membrane potential, synaptosomal mitochondrial metabolic function and tissue Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activities observed in the ischaemic brains were also attenuated by honokiol treatments. It is concluded that honokiol can protect brain against ischaemic reperfusion injury and preserve mitochondrial function from oxidative stress. Regarding therapeutic application, further studies are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of honokiol in clinical situations.          "
Magnolia Officinalis,Outcomes of an electronic social network intervention with neuro-oncology patient family caregivers - PubMed,"        Introduction:                    Informal family caregivers (FCG) are an integral and crucial human component in the cancer care continuum. However, research and interventions to help alleviate documented anxiety and burden on this group is lacking. To address the absence of effective interventions, we developed the electronic Support Network Assessment Program (eSNAP) which aims to automate the capture and visualization of social support, an important target for overall FCG support. This study seeks to describe the preliminary efficacy and outcomes of the eSNAP intervention.                  Methods:                    Forty FCGs were enrolled into a longitudinal, two-group randomized design to compare the eSNAP intervention in caregivers of patients with primary brain tumors against controls who did not receive the intervention. Participants were followed for six weeks with questionnaires to assess demographics, caregiver burden, anxiety, depression, and social support. Questionnaires given at baseline (T1) and then 3-weeks (T2), and 6-weeks (T3) post baseline questionnaire.                  Results:                    FCGs reported high caregiver burden and distress at baseline, with burden remaining stable over the course of the study. The intervention group was significantly less depressed, but anxiety remained stable across groups.                  Conclusions:                    With the lessons learned and feedback obtained from FCGs, this study is the first step to developing an effective social support intervention to support FCGs and healthcare providers in improving cancer care.

Magnolia Officinalis,Formulations of dietary supplements and herbal extracts for relaxation and anxiolytic action: Relarian - PubMed,"              Dietary supplements are widely used for desired effects on memory, insomnia, mood and anxiety. This review focuses on supplements which have anxiolytic or mild relaxation properties and enhance mood. For example, Kava (Piper methysticum) is reported to have anaxiolytic actions and to reduce tension through skeletal muscle relaxation. Dried passion flower (genus Passiflora) is reported to reduce insomnia and hysteria. Skullcap (genus Scutellaria), hops (Humulus lupulus), lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) and Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) root are all herbs reported as anaxiolytic calming agents. Further, extracts of Magnolia and Phellondendron bark are mild sedatives. Supplements such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), theanine, tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) are reported to promote relaxation. In general, these supplements appear to act as GABA receptor agonists or to boost GABA levels, although Kava inhibits both norephinephrine uptake and sodium and potassium channels and 5-HTP may act through elevation of serotonin. While questions remain in the literature regarding the medicinal value of these supplements in treating mood and anxiety disorders, based on cellular and animal studies as well as human clinical trials the literature supports a role for these preparations as useful alternatives in the management of the stress and anxiety of everyday life.

Magnolia Officinalis,"Effect of a proprietary Magnolia and Phellodendron extract on stress levels in healthy women: a pilot, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial - PubMed","        Background:                    Recent research has established correlations between stress, anxiety, insomnia and excess body weight and these correlations have significant implications for health. This study measured the effects of a proprietary blend of extracts of Magnolia officinalis and Phellodendron amurense (Relora) on anxiety, stress and sleep in healthy premenopausal women.                  Methods:                    This randomized, parallel, placebo controlled clinical study was conducted with healthy, overweight (BMI 25 to 34.9), premenopausal female adults, between the ages of 20 and 50 years, who typically eat more in response to stressful situations and scores above the national mean for women on self-reporting anxiety. The intervention was Relora (250 mg capsules) or identical placebo 3 times daily for 6 weeks. Anxiety as measured by the Spielberger STATE-TRAIT questionnaires, salivary amylase and cortisol levels, Likert Scales/Visual Analog Scores for sleep quality and latency, appetite, and clinical markers of safety. The study was conducted by Miami Research Associates, a clinical research organization in Miami, FL.                  Results:                    The intent-to-treat population consisted of 40 subjects with 26 participants completing the study. There were no significant adverse events. Relora was effective, in comparison to placebo, in reducing temporary, transitory anxiety as measured by the Spielberger STATE anxiety questionnaire. It was not effective in reducing long-standing feelings of anxiety or depression as measured using the Spielberger TRAIT questionnaire. Other assessments conducted in this study including salivary cortisol and amylase levels, appetite, body morphology and sleep quality/latency were not significantly changed by Relora in comparison to placebo.                  Conclusion:                    This pilot study indicates that Relora may offer some relief for premenopausal women experiencing mild transitory anxiety. There were no safety concerns or significant adverse events observed in this study.          "
Magnolia Officinalis,Effect of Magnolia officinalis and Phellodendron amurense (Relora®) on cortisol and psychological mood state in moderately stressed subjects - PubMed,"        Background:                    Magnolia (Magnolia officinalis) and Phellodendron (Phellodendron amurense) barks are medicinal plants commonly used as traditional remedies for reducing stress and anxiety. Modern dietary supplements are intended to induce relaxation and reduce stress as well as stress-related eating. Previous studies have shown the combination of Magnolia/Phellodendron (MP) to reduce both cortisol exposure and the perception of stress/anxiety, while improving weight loss in subjects with stress-related eating. Competitive athletes are ""stressed"" by their intense exercise regimens in addition to their normal activities of daily living and thus may benefit from a natural therapy intended to modulate baseline perceptions of stress and stress hormone exposure.                  Methods:                    We assessed salivary cortisol exposure and psychological mood state in 56 subjects (35 men and 21 women) screened for moderate stress and supplemented with a standardized/patented MP combination (Relora®, Next Pharmaceuticals) or Placebo for 4 weeks.                  Results:                    After 4 weeks of supplementation, salivary cortisol exposure was significantly (p<0.05) lower (-18%) in the Relora group compared to Placebo. Compared to Placebo, the Relora group had significantly better (p<0.05) mood state parameters, including lower indices of Overall Stress (-11%), Tension (-13%), Depression (-20%), Anger (-42%), Fatigue (-31%), and Confusion (-27%), and higher indices of Global Mood State (+11%) and Vigor (+18%).                  Conclusion:                    These results indicate that daily supplementation with a combination of Magnolia bark extract and Phellodendron bark extract (Relora®) reduces cortisol exposure and perceived daily stress, while improving a variety of mood state parameters, including lower fatigue and higher vigor. These results suggest an effective natural approach to modulating the detrimental health effects of chronic stress in moderately stressed adults. Future studies should examine the possible performance and recovery benefits of Relora supplementation in athletes overstressed by the physical and psychological demands of training and competition.

Magnolia Officinalis,Bioinspired Honokiol Analogs and Their Evaluation for Activity on the Norepinephrine Transporter - PubMed,"              In traditional Asian medicinal systems, preparations of the root and stem bark of Magnolia species are widely used to treat anxiety and other nervous disturbances. The biphenyl-type neolignans honokiol and magnolol are the main constituents of Magnolia bark extracts. In the central nervous system, Magnolia bark preparations that contain honokiol are thought to primarily interact with γ-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptors. However, stress responses inherently involve the noradrenergic system, which has not been investigated in the pharmacological mechanism of honokiol. We present here interactions of honokiol and other synthesized biphenyl-type neolignans and diphenylmethane analogs with the norepinephrine transporter (NET), which is responsible for the synaptic clearance of norepinephrine and the target of many anxiolytics. Of the synthesized compounds, 16 are new chemical entities, which are fully characterized. The 52 compounds tested show mild, non-potent interactions with NET (IC50 > 100 µM). It is thus likely that the observed anxiolytic effects of, e.g., Magnolia preparations, are not due to direct interaction with the noradrenergic system.          "
Magnolia Officinalis,Caring for a spouse with advanced cancer: similarities and differences for male and female caregivers - PubMed,"              Most caregiving literature has focused on women, who have traditionally taken on caregiving roles. However, more research is needed to clarify the mixed evidence regarding the impact of gender on caregiver/patient psychological outcomes, especially in an advanced cancer context. In this paper, we examine gender differences in caregiver stress, burden, anxiety, depression, and coping styles, as well as how caregiver gender impacts patient outcomes in the context of advanced cancer. Eighty-eight patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers completed psychosocial surveys. All couples were heterosexual and most caregivers were women (71.6%). Female caregivers reported significantly higher levels of perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and social strain compared with male caregivers, and female patients of male caregivers were more likely to use social support as a coping style compared with male patients of female caregivers. These findings highlight the potential differences between male and female caregivers' needs and psychological health.          "
Magnolia Officinalis,Therapeutic applications of compounds in the Magnolia family - PubMed,"              The bark and/or seed cones of the Magnolia tree have been used in traditional herbal medicines in Korea, China and Japan. Bioactive ingredients such as magnolol, honokiol, 4-O-methylhonokiol and obovatol have received great attention, judging by the large number of investigators who have studied their pharmacological effects for the treatment of various diseases. Recently, many investigators reported the anti-cancer, anti-stress, anti-anxiety, anti-depressant, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects as well as toxicities and pharmacokinetics data, however, the mechanisms underlying these pharmacological activities are not clear. The aim of this study was to review a variety of experimental and clinical reports and, describe the effectiveness, toxicities and pharmacokinetics, and possible mechanisms of Magnolia and/or its constituents.

Magnolia Officinalis,"Effect of a proprietary Magnolia and Phellodendron extract on weight management: a pilot, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial - PubMed","        Objective:                    To determine the efficacy of a dietary supplement ingredient containing proprietary extracts of Magnolia officinalis and Phellodendron amurense in helping overweight, otherwise healthy, premenopausal female adults, who typically eat more in stressful situations manage their body weight.                  Design:                    Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study. Setting Miami Research Associates, a clinical research organization consisting of 32 board-certified physicians, Miami, Fla.                  Subjects:                    Healthy, overweight (BMI 25 to 34.9), premenopausal female adults, between the ages of 20 and 50 years, who typically eat more in response to stressful situations and scored above the national mean for women on self-reported anxiety.                  Interventions:                    Two-hundred-fifty-mg capsules or identical placebo capsules 3 times a day for 6 weeks.                  Main outcome measures:                    Salivary cortisol levels, weight change, psychological measures of stress and anxiety.                  Results:                    Twenty-eight subjects completed the study. Extracts of M officinalis and P amurense were well tolerated. There was a significant weight gain during the study for the placebo group (P < ,01), but no significant weight gain for the group receiving extracts of M officinalis and P amurense (P < .89). Paired t-tests comparing baseline to post-treatment weight showed an average gain of 1.5 kg in the placebo group and no change in the treatment group (P = .89). When groups were divided into gainers (ie, participants who gained at least 1 kg or more) and maintainers or losers, 75% of the control group were gainers versus 37% of the treatment group (P < .04). There was a nonsignificant trend for lowered average cortisol in the treatment group at the end of the study (group X time interaction, F = 1.1, P < .15). This difference was due to a treatment effect on evening cortisol. There was a marginally significant group X time interaction (P = .06), showing the treatment group tended to have lower levels of cortisol in the evening, whereas the control group tended to have higher levels of cortisol in the evening. Bedtime cortisol levels decreased in the treatment group and increased in the placebo group. Participants in both the treatment and placebo groups had improved scores on a number of psychological measures during the study. There was a correlation between perceived stress and weight change.                  Conclusion:                    The results of this pilot clinical study indicate that obese subjects who eat in response to stress may benefit from taking a dietary supplement ingredient containing proprietary extracts of M officinalis and P amurense. The mechanism of action appears to be through reduction of cortisol levels and possibly perceived stress, thereby helping participants maintain body weight. The sample size was small, however, and there was higher attrition in the control group than in the treatment group.          "
Magnolia Officinalis,Magnolia officinalis (Hou Po) bark extract stimulates the Nrf2-pathway in hepatocytes and protects against oxidative stress - PubMed,"        Ethnopharmacological relevance:                    The highly aromatic bark of Magnolia officinalis Rehder and EH Wilson, (magnolia bark) has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine where it is known as Hou Po. Historically the bark of the tree has been used for treating variety of disorders the most common use of magnolia bark in traditional prescription has been to treat stress and anxiety disorders. Till date it is not clear regarding the fundamental cellular pathway it modulates. NRF2 signaling has emerged as the central pathway that protects cells from variety of stressors this led us to hypothesize that basis for magnolia bark's effects could be via activating NRF2 pathway.                  Materials and methods:                    We utilized variety of biochemical procedures like luciferase reporter assay, enzyme induction, gene expression to determine NRF2 inducing activity by magnolia bark extract and its significance. Further we identified the phytochemicals inducing this activity using bio-directed fractionation procedure.                  Results:                    In this study, we demonstrate that magnolia bark extract activates Nrf2-dependent gene expression and protects against hydrogen peroxide mediated oxidative stress in hepatocytes. We further identified through HPLC fractionation and mass spectroscopy that magnolol, 4-methoxy honokiol and honokiol are the active phytochemicals inducing the Nrf2-mediated activity. This could be the molecular basis for its numerous beneficial activity.          "
Magnolia Officinalis,Modulation of Rat Hepatic CYP1A and 2C Activity by Honokiol and Magnolol: Differential Effects on Phenacetin and Diclofenac Pharmacokinetics In Vivo - PubMed,"              Honokiol (2-(4-hydroxy-3-prop-2-enyl-phenyl)-4-prop-2-enyl-phenol) and magnolol (4-Allyl-2-(5-allyl-2-hydroxy-phenyl)phenol) are the major active polyphenol constituents of Magnolia officinalis (Magnoliaceae) bark, which has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine (Houpu Tang) for the treatment of various diseases, including anxiety, stress, gastrointestinal disorders, infection, and asthma. The aim of this study was to investigate the direct effects of honokiol and magnolol on hepatic CYP1A and 2C-mediated metabolism in vitro using rat liver microsomes and in vivo using the Sprague-Dawley rat model. Honokiol and magnolol inhibited in vitro CYP1A activity (probe substrate: phenacetin) more potently than CYP2C activity (probe substrate: diclofenac): The mean IC50 values of honokiol for the metabolism of phenacetin and diclofenac were 8.59 μM and 44.7 μM, while those of magnolol were 19.0 μM and 47.3 μM, respectively. Notably, the systemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) of phenacetin, but not of diclofenac, was markedly enhanced by the concurrent administration of intravenous honokiol or magnolol. The differential effects of the two phytochemicals on phenacetin and diclofenac in vivo pharmacokinetics could at least be partly attributed to their lower IC50 values for the inhibition of phenacetin metabolism than for diclofenac metabolism. In addition, the systemic exposure, CL, and Vss of honokiol and magnolol tended to be similar between the rat groups receiving phenacetin and diclofenac. These findings improve our understanding of CYP-mediated drug interactions with M. officinalis and its active constituents.          "
Magnolia Officinalis,Trajectories of diurnal cortisol in mothers of children with autism and other developmental disabilities: relations to health and mental health - PubMed,"              This study used a stress biomarker, diurnal cortisol, to identify how elevated stress in mothers of children and adults with autism and other disabilities relates to their health and mental health. Based on semi-parametric, group-based trajectory analysis of 91 mothers, two distinctive cortisol trajectories emerged: blunted (63 %) or steep (37 %). Mothers in the blunted (vs. steep) trajectory had higher stress levels, lower health ratings, and 89 % of mothers of children with autism, and 53 % with other disabilities, belonged to this trajectory. Atypical cortisol awakening responses and evening rises were differentially associated with anxiety, depression, health problems and employment status. Stress-reducing interventions are needed for parents of children with autism and other disabilities that include biomarkers as indices of risk or treatment outcome.           "

lemon balm,Police Interactions and the Mental Health of Black Americans: a Systematic Review - PubMed,"              Black Americans comprise 13% of the US population, yet data suggests that they represent 23% of those fatally shot by police officers. Data on non-lethal encounters with police in the Black community is less available but can understandably result in emotional trauma, stress responses, and depressive symptoms. The aim of this systematic literature review is to assess if interactions with the police are associated with mental health outcomes among Black Americans. Following pre-defined inclusion criteria, 11 articles were reviewed. Using a quality assessment tool, eight studies received a fair quality rating, two studies a poor rating, and one study received a good rating. The types of police interaction reported among study participants included police use of force during arrest, police stops, police searches, exposure to police killings, and interactions with police in the court system and varied mental health outcomes. Most of the studies (6 of 11) reviewed found statistically significant associations between police interactions and mental health (psychotic experiences, psychological distress, depression, PTSD, anxiety, suicidal ideation and attempts), indicating a nearly twofold higher prevalence of poor mental health among those reporting a prior police interaction compared to those with no interaction. Although better quality studies are needed, findings suggest an association between police interactions and negative mental health outcomes. Changes in law enforcement policy, development and implementation of a validated instrument for police experiences, improved community outreach, a federally mandated review of policy and practice in police departments, and expanded police training initiatives could reduce the potential negative mental health impact of police interactions on Black Americans.

lemon balm,Patterns of women׳s mood after delivery: a growth curve analysis - PubMed,"        Background:                    The course and predictors of women׳s mood following childbirth have informed clinically significant phenomena, such as postpartum depression (PPD), with some contradictory findings due to methodological limitations. It is important to further investigate mood during this unique period of time to inform assessment and improve interventions.                  Methods:                    Recently delivered mothers (n=216) recruited from the maternity unit at a University hospital completed sociodemographic questions and the Daily Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ), a measure of Negative Affect (NA) and Positive Affect (PA), for 10 consecutive days. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV was administered to assess postpartum depression diagnosis.                  Results:                    Growth curve modeling (GCM) techniques revealed average trends in mood following delivery. NA changed in a curvilinear fashion with a peak at day 5. PA declined rapidly during the days immediately following delivery and then stabilized. Women diagnosed with PPD experienced higher overall levels of NA and lower levels of PA from delivery to 10 days postpartum. Patterns of mood varied as a function of neuroticism and several well-established sociodemographic variables.                  Limitations:                    Small sample size and relatively few ethnic minority participants may affect generalizability of the findings.                  Conclusions:                    NA changed in a pattern consistent with the ""peaking phenomenon"". Well-established risk factors of the blues had significant associations with mood from delivery to day 10. Increased understanding into the nature of NA and PA in the early postpartum, and its role in identifying women susceptible to experiencing PPD, can inform screening and therapeutic interventions for PPD.

lemon balm,Sex differences in coping strategies in military survival school - PubMed,"              A wealth of research has examined psychological responses to trauma among male military service members, but few studies have examined sex differences in response to trauma, such as coping strategies. This study assessed coping strategies used by male and female U.S. service members completing an intensely stressful mock-captivity exercise, compared strategies by sex, and assessed the relationship between coping and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Two hundred service members (78% male) completed self-report surveys before and after mock captivity. Surveys assessed demographics, service characteristics, PTSS, and coping strategies used during mock captivity. Participants used seven coping strategies: denial, self-blame, religion, self-distraction, behavioral disengagement, positive reframing, and planning. Women used denial (p≤.05), self-blame (p≤.05), and positive reinterpretation (p≤.05) strategies more frequently than men, and they had higher PTSS levels following the exercise. Structural equation modeling showed that the relationship between sex and PTSS was fully mediated by coping strategies. The results of this study suggest that reducing the use of maladaptive coping strategies may mitigate PTSS among females. Future efforts should target improving coping during highly stressful and traumatic experiences.          "
lemon balm,Anxiolytic effects of a combination of Melissa officinalis and Valeriana officinalis during laboratory induced stress - PubMed,"        Objective:                    Melissa officinalis (lemon balm) and Valeriana officinalis (valerian) have been used both traditionally and contemporaneously as mild sedatives, anxiolytics and hypnotics. Recent research has suggested that both may attenuate laboratory induced stress. As the two herbs are most often sold in combination with each other the current study assessed the anxiolytic properties of such a combination during laboratory-induced stress.                  Methods:                    In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, balanced cross-over experiment, 24 healthy volunteers received three separate single doses (600 mg, 1200 mg, 1800 mg) of a standardized product containing M. officinalis and V. officinalis extracts, plus a placebo, on separate days separated by a 7 day wash out period. Modulation of mood and anxiety were assessed during pre-dose and 1 h, 3 h and 6 h post-dose completions of a 20 min version of the Defined Intensity Stressor Simulation (DISS) battery. Cognitive performance on the four concurrent tasks of the battery was also assessed.                  Results:                    The results showed that the 600 mg dose of the combination ameliorated the negative effects of the DISS on ratings of anxiety. However, the highest dose (1800 mg) showed an increase in anxiety that was less marked but which reached significance during one testing session. In addition, all three doses led to decrements in performance on the Stroop task module within the battery, and the two lower doses led to decrements on the overall score generated on the DISS battery.                  Conclusions:                    These results suggest that a combination of Melissa officinalis and Valeriana officinalis possesses anxiolytic properties that deserve further investigation.

lemon balm,"The relative importance of psychosocial factors in arthritis: findings from 10,509 Australian women - PubMed","        Objective:                    To determine the relative importance of psychosocial factors in arthritis diagnosis in an ageing cohort of Australian women.                  Methods:                    This study focused on 10,509 women from the 1946-1951 cohort who responded to questions on arthritis in the fifth mailed population-based survey of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health conducted in 2007.                  Results:                    Arthritis was characterised by widespread psychosocial concerns, particularly relating to chronic stress and poor mental health. Univariate analyses revealed that in comparison to women without stress, women with moderate/high stress levels had a 2.5-fold increase in reporting arthritis. Experiencing ongoing negative interpersonal life events concerning illness of a family member/close friend and relationship difficulties was also associated with a 1.4-fold increase in the reporting of arthritis. Likewise, significantly reduced levels of optimism and perceived social support were noted (all associations p<.001). Psychiatric diagnosis was also associated with a two-fold increase in having arthritis (p<.001). Following adjustment for behavioural, demographic and health-related characteristics, anxiety was the only psychosocial factor associated with arthritis (OR=1.4, 95% CI=1.2, 1.7; p<.001).                  Conclusion:                    This study examined, epidemiologically, the relative importance of psychosocial factors in arthritis in an ageing cohort of Australian women. The findings from this population-based study indicate that women with arthritis are more likely to report a range of psychosocial-related problems, particularly with regard to chronic stress perception and anxiety. Longitudinal analyses are required to examine the processes by which stress and psychosocial factors may contribute to arthritis risk and poor adaptation in terms of health-related quality of life.

lemon balm,Immediate post-treatment supportive care needs of patients newly diagnosed with head and neck cancer - PubMed,"        Objective:                    This study aimed at identifying supportive care needs of patients with head and neck cancer (HNC-P) immediately post-treatment, finding early predictors of unmet needs, and contrasting how immediate post-treatment needs differed from needs in longer-term survivorship.                  Methods:                    Prospective longitudinal study of 223 consecutive adults (313 approached; 72% participation) newly diagnosed with a first occurrence of primary HNC. Patients completed the Supportive Care Needs Survey-Short Form (SCNS), the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, and other outcomes. Medical chart reviews were conducted.                  Results:                    A total of 68% of patients (n = 145/223) completed the SCNS. The multiple linear regression indicated that when controlled for medical variables, patients presented higher levels of unmet needs when they presented with higher level of anxiety upon HNC diagnosis (p = 0.03), higher neuroticism (p = 0.03), and more stressful life events in the year pre-diagnosis (p = 0.01). Patients immediately post-treatment had a wider variety of unmet needs compared with those in extended survivorship, with psychological unmet needs most prevalent at both time points. Immediately post-treatment, patients needed more support regarding pain (p = 0.04) and worries about treatment results (p = 0.05), whereas patients in longer-term survivorship needed more support regarding anxiety (p = 0.02), changes in sexual relationships (p = 0.04), and fear of death and dying (p = 0.001).                  Conclusion:                    This study identifies areas needing further development to improve quality of care for HNC-P in the immediate post-treatment period, as well as early determinants of unmet needs. HNC clinics may want to routinely screen for anxiety, neuroticism, and burden from other life events, to pro-actively address needs upon treatment completion and alleviate disease burden.          "
lemon balm,Formulations of dietary supplements and herbal extracts for relaxation and anxiolytic action: Relarian - PubMed,"              Dietary supplements are widely used for desired effects on memory, insomnia, mood and anxiety. This review focuses on supplements which have anxiolytic or mild relaxation properties and enhance mood. For example, Kava (Piper methysticum) is reported to have anaxiolytic actions and to reduce tension through skeletal muscle relaxation. Dried passion flower (genus Passiflora) is reported to reduce insomnia and hysteria. Skullcap (genus Scutellaria), hops (Humulus lupulus), lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) and Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) root are all herbs reported as anaxiolytic calming agents. Further, extracts of Magnolia and Phellondendron bark are mild sedatives. Supplements such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), theanine, tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) are reported to promote relaxation. In general, these supplements appear to act as GABA receptor agonists or to boost GABA levels, although Kava inhibits both norephinephrine uptake and sodium and potassium channels and 5-HTP may act through elevation of serotonin. While questions remain in the literature regarding the medicinal value of these supplements in treating mood and anxiety disorders, based on cellular and animal studies as well as human clinical trials the literature supports a role for these preparations as useful alternatives in the management of the stress and anxiety of everyday life.

lemon balm,"Psychological Distress in Solitary Confinement: Symptoms, Severity, and Prevalence in the United States, 2017-2018 - PubMed","Objectives. To specify symptoms and measure prevalence of psychological distress among incarcerated people in long-term solitary confinement.Methods. We gathered data via semistructured, in-depth interviews; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) assessments; and systematic reviews of medical and disciplinary files for 106 randomly selected people in solitary confinement in the Washington State Department of Corrections in 2017. We performed 1-year follow-up interviews and BPRS assessments with 80 of these incarcerated people, and we present the results of our qualitative content analysis and descriptive statistics.Results. BPRS results showed clinically significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, or guilt among half of our research sample. Administrative data showed disproportionately high rates of serious mental illness and self-harming behavior compared with general prison populations. Interview content analysis revealed additional symptoms, including social isolation, loss of identity, and sensory hypersensitivity.Conclusions. Our coordinated study of rating scale, interview, and administrative data illustrates the public health crisis of solitary confinement. Because 95% or more of all incarcerated people, including those who experienced solitary confinement, are eventually released, understanding disproportionate psychopathology matters for developing prevention policies and addressing the unique needs of people who have experienced solitary confinement, an extreme element of mass incarceration.

lemon balm,Cognitive regulation of emotion in bipolar I disorder and unaffected biological relatives - PubMed,"        Objective:                    We examined the use of particular cognitive strategies for regulating negative emotion in relation to mood and temperament in BD-I, unaffected relatives of bipolar patients (UR), and healthy controls (HC).                  Method:                    Participants were 105 patients with BD-I, 124 UR, and 63 HC; all participants completed the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS), and the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS).                  Results:                    The BD-I group reported more frequent use of rumination, catastrophizing and self-blame, and less frequent use of putting into perspective, in response to negative life events, relative to the UR and HC groups. In BD-I, more frequent use of rumination was associated with increased DASS and HPS scores. By contrast, within the UR group, more frequent use of catastrophizing and self-blame were associated with increased DASS and HPS scores. In all participants, less frequent use of adaptive cognitive reframing strategies (e.g. putting into perspective) were associated with increased DASS scores.                  Conclusion:                    Both BD-I and UR groups reported more frequent use of maladaptive regulatory strategies previously associated with depression. Emotion regulation strategies of catastrophizing, self-blame, and cognitive reframing techniques may be associated with vulnerability for mood disorders, with the latter active within the general population regardless of biological vulnerability to disorder.

lemon balm,Longitudinal risk factors for adverse psychological functioning six months after coronary artery bypass graft surgery - PubMed,"              This research aimed to identify modifiable risk factors for poor psychological functioning six months post-operatively, using a chronic illness model to explain the relationships between risk factors. Consecutive elective CABG patients (N = 119) completed self-report measures including optimism, illness representations, self-rated health, social support, coping methods, depression, anxiety and PTSD symptomatology in a repeated measures design. Poor pre-operative psychological functioning was the strongest psychological risk factor for adverse psychological functioning six months post-operatively. Longitudinal support for the chronic illness model examined was limited. Further research to identify modifiable risk factors and pre-operative psychopathology screening to determine individuals at-risk of poor psychological outcome is recommended.          "
lemon balm,"The effects of Melissa officinalis supplementation on depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep disorder in patients with chronic stable angina - PubMed","        Background:                    Despite advances in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in recent decades, patients experience high levels of depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia. Since the calming effect of Melissa officinalis (MO) has been known, this study aimed to determine the effects of MO supplementation on depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep disturbances in patients with chronic stable angina (CSA).                  Methods:                    In this double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, 80 patients with CSA were divided randomly into two groups (taking 3 g MO supplement or placebo daily for 8 weeks). The shortened 21-item version of the depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21) test and Pittsburgh sleep quality index were done before and after the intervention.                  Results:                    At the end of the study, the intervention group receiving MO capsules had a significant reduction in scores of depression, anxiety, stress, and total sleep disturbance, compared with the placebo group (P < 0.05).                  Conclusions:                    The results showed that 8-week supplementation with 3 g MO can decrease depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep disorder in patients with CSA.          "
lemon balm,"The relationships between mobile phone use and depressive symptoms, bodily pain, and daytime sleepiness in Hong Kong secondary school students - PubMed","        Introduction:                    Studies have found that increased mobile phone use (MPU) is associated with multiple health issues such as depression, disordered sleep and pain. However, the current situation and interrelationships of these problems remain unexplored in the Hong Kong population.                  Objectives:                    This study aimed to understand the situation and problematic use of mobile phones by Hong Kong secondary school students and to investigate depressive symptoms, bodily pain and daytime sleepiness and the associations of these factors with MPU in Hong Kong secondary school students.                  Methods:                    This quantitative cross-sectional design study was based on self-administered questionnaires completed at five secondary schools. The questionnaire comprised five sections: MPU as measured by the Chinese version of the 10-Item Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale (CMPPUS-10); depressive symptoms according to the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 Chinese Version (DASS-21); bodily pain according to the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form Chinese (BPISF-C); daytime sleepiness as measured using the Chinese version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (CESS) and socio-demographic questions.                  Results:                    A total of 686 students were recruited. The CMPPUS-10 score correlated positively with the average daily duration of MPU and the presence of depression, daytime sleepiness and bodily pain. Problematic mobile phone users received significantly higher scores for depression severity, bodily pain and daytime sleepiness. Health problems were significantly more severe in female than in male students. Bodily pain and daytime sleepiness mediated the relationship of MPU with depression.                  Conclusions:                    Problematic MPU was associated with depression, bodily pain and daytime sleepiness. These findings will inform further studies of MPU-related health problems.

Methods:                    This is an analytical cross-sectional study. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were collected, along with levels of anxiety, stress and depression from 309 outpatients.                  Results:                    The mean levels of stress, anxiety and depression were correlated but low. Time since diagnosis, the disease's functional class, family income, and smoking influenced stress. Functional class and Chagas disease influenced anxiety and depression. Being unemployed and smoking influenced anxiety, while being a homeowner influenced depression.                  Conclusion:                    These findings should be considered when planning nursing interventions.          "
lemon balm,"The center of the emotional universe: Alcohol, stress, and CRF1 amygdala circuitry - PubMed","              The commonalities between different phases of stress and alcohol use as well as the high comorbidity between alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and anxiety disorders suggest common underlying cellular mechanisms governing the rewarding and aversive aspects of these related conditions. As an integrative center that assigns emotional salience to a wide variety of internal and external stimuli, the amygdala complex plays a major role in how alcohol and stress influence cellular physiology to produce disordered behavior. Previous work has illustrated the broad role of the amygdala in alcohol, stress, and anxiety. However, the challenge of current and future studies is to identify the specific dysregulations that occur within distinct amygdala circuits and subpopulations and the commonalities between these alterations in each disorder, with the long-term goal of identifying potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Specific intra-amygdala circuits and cell type-specific subpopulations are emerging as critical targets for stress- and alcohol-induced plasticity, chief among them the corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and CRF receptor 1 (CRF1) system. CRF and CRF1 have been implicated in the effects of alcohol in several amygdala nuclei, including the basolateral (BLA) and central amygdala (CeA); however, the precise circuitry involved in these effects and the role of these circuits in stress and anxiety are only beginning to be understood.

lemon balm,Experimental avoidance as a mediator of the effects of adolescent sexual victimization on negative adult outcomes - PubMed,"              The study examined experiential avoidance as a mediator between sexual victimization and negative adult outcomes. Baron and Kenny's (1986) regression analyses were performed on a sample of 304 undergraduate women to assess direct and indirect effects of sexual victimization on depressive, psychological distress, and alcohol abuse symptoms. Experiential avoidance accounted for statistically significant, but modest effects of victimization on depressive and distress symptoms. Child sexual abuse was not directly associated with experiential avoidance or negative outcomes, but increased vulnerability for adolescent sexual victimization. Adolescent sexual victimization contributed to increased experiential avoidance, which was associated with greater negative outcomes. These results uniquely contribute to the existing literature linking experiential avoidance to psychological problems.          "
lemon balm,Effects of chronic administration of Melissa officinalis L. extract on anxiety-like reactivity and on circadian and exploratory activities in mice - PubMed,"              This study aimed to determine the effects of chronic (15 consecutive days of treatment) per os administration of Melissa officinalis L. extract (Cyracos, Naturex) on anxiety-like reactivity in mice. As measured by HPLC, Cyracos contains significant amounts of rosmarinic acid and the triterpenoids oleanolic acid and ursolic acid, which inhibit gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T) activity and increase GABA levels in the brain (Awad et al., 2007; Awad et al., 2009). Thus, we evaluated Cyracos use in independent groups of C57BL/6 mice with regard to anxiety-like reactivity in an elevated plus maze and an open field task. We found that Cyracos significantly reduced anxiety-like reactivity in the elevated plus maze dose-dependently, but no significant effect was observed in the open field task. Parallel experiments in independent groups of mice showed that the Cyracosdose at which it exerted anxiolytic-like effects in the elevated plus maze did not alter exploratory or circadian activities. Therefore, our results demonstrate that Cyracos has anxiolytic-like effects under moderate stress conditions and does not alter activity levels.          "
lemon balm,"Glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) DNA methylation in association with trauma, psychopathology, transcript expression, or genotypic variation: A systematic review - PubMed","              The glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) is a critical component of the stress response system. Cytosine methylation of NR3C1 has been repeatedly associated with trauma and mental disorders, including major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and personality disorders, suggesting that NR3C1 methylation may play a role in stress-related psychopathology. We systematically reviewed 55 studies examining NR3C1 DNA methylation in association with trauma exposure, psychopathology, gene expression, and/or common genetic variants. Overall, a number of NR3C1 CpG sites were significantly associated with trauma or psychopathology, but significant findings were often inconsistent across studies. This lack of consistency is likely influenced by significant methodological variability - experimentally and analytically - across studies. Selected common genetic variants show no significant effect on NR3C1 CpG methylation. In contrast, there was ample evidence linking increased methylation of NR3C1 to reduced expression of this gene. The inverse association between methylation and gene expression shown across eight out of ten studies supports the notion that methylation in the promoter region of NR3C1 is associated with transcriptional silencing.

lemon balm,Mindfulness-based stress reduction in an integrated care delivery system: one-year impacts on patient-centered outcomes and health care utilization - PubMed,"        Background:                    Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) programs have demonstrated clinical effectiveness for both mental and physical health conditions. Less research exists on health services utilization, self-efficacy, or work productivity outcomes.                  Objective:                    To assess one-year outcomes of MBSR in patients with chronic pain, chronic illness, or stress-related problems, measuring functional status, pain, self-efficacy, depression, anxiety, somatization, psychological distress, work productivity, and changes in health services utilization.                  Methods:                    A prospective single cohort design evaluated an eight-week MBSR program for Kaiser Permanente Colorado members. Patient-reported measures were collected at baseline, eight weeks, and one year following MBSR. Differences in health services utilization were compared from six months before MBSR to six months following the one-year anniversary of MBSR.                  Results:                    Most of the 38 participants were white (28; 74%), female (30; 79%), employed part-time (35; 92%), and average age 52.6 years, with multiple comorbidities (averaging 16.4 unique diagnoses), the most common being joint or back pain (28; 74%) and psychological disorder (20; 53%). Repeated measures analyses at 8 weeks (n = 26) and at 1 year (n = 24) showed significant improvements in self-reported mental and physical function, pain, psychological symptoms, and self-efficacy, but not work productivity. Significant decreases at 1 year were observed for visits in primary care (-50%, p < 0.0001), specialty care (-38%, p = 0.0004), and the Emergency Department (-50%, p = 0.04), and for hospital admissions (-80%, p = 0.02).                  Conclusion:                    The MBSR program was associated with improvements in several patient-centered outcomes over 1 year and reductions in health services utilization up to 18 months.

lemon balm,Pilot trial of Melissa officinalis L. leaf extract in the treatment of volunteers suffering from mild-to-moderate anxiety disorders and sleep disturbances - PubMed,"              Botanicals are an alternative option to prescription drugs for the alleviation of symptoms due to anxiety disorders and insomnia. Melissa officinalis L. has been shown as an anti-stress and anxiolytic agent. We previously reported moderate stress improvement in mice in which Cyracos(®), a standardized Melissa officinalis L. extract, was administrated. Cyracos(®) contains phytochemicals that inhibit gamma-aminobutyric acid catabolism. This was a prospective, open-label, 15-day study to evaluate the efficacy of Cyracos(®) on stressed volunteers, who have mild-to-moderate anxiety disorders and sleep disturbances. Using clinician rating criteria, primary outcomes showed improvement of symptoms. Cyracos(®) reduced anxiety manifestations by 18% (p < 0.01), ameliorated anxiety-associated symptoms by 15% (p < 0.01) and lowered insomnia by 42% (p < 0.01). As much as 95% of subjects (19/20) responded to treatment, of which 70% (14/20) achieved full remission for anxiety, 85% (17/20) for insomnia, and 70% (14/20) for both. Our study demonstrates, for the first time that chronic administration of Melissa officinalis L. relieves stress-related effects. It is critical that further studies incorporate a placebo and investigate physiological stress markers.          "
lemon balm,Relationship between Diet and Mental Health in a Young Adult Appalachian College Population - PubMed,"              Young adults in Appalachia may face poor nutritional status due to low access to healthy food and high mental health symptoms attributed to high stress and the college environment. A cross-sectional design was used to investigate the relationship between diet intake and mental health status of this population via surveys. Participant responses (n = 1956) showed students' mean number of depressed days over the past 30 days was 9.67 ± 8.80, and of anxious days, 14.1 ± 10.03. The mean fruit and vegetable intake was 1.80 ± 1.27 times per day and the mean added sugars intake was 1.79 ± 1.26 times per day. 36.7% of students were found to be food insecure. One-way ANOVA and Chi-Squared analyses were used to determine relationship between variables. Significant variables were placed into a full logistic regression model. Food insecurity and fruit and vegetable intake remained significant predictors of depression in males (odds ratio (OR) = 2.33 95% CI 1.47⁻3.71 and OR = 68 95% CI 50⁻89, respectively) and in females food insecurity remained a significant predictor of depression (OR = 2.26 95% CI 1.67⁻3.07). Food insecurity and added sugars intake were significant predictor of anxiety in males (OR = 2.33 95% CI 1.47⁻3.71 and OR = 1.09 95% CI 0.91⁻1.3, respectively) and for anxiety in females, added sugars intake and food insecurity were significant predictors (OR = 1.18 95% CI 1.05⁻1.32 and OR = 1.65 95% CI 1.27⁻2.16, respectively). Improving college student's diet intake through increased access to healthy foods could improve the mental health and well-being of students.          "
lemon balm,Unmet need for mental health care among veterans receiving palliative care: assessment is not enough - PubMed,"        Objective:                    To determine whether inpatient palliative care teams' assessments of psychological distress affect receipt of in-hospital mental health care (psychotherapy, psychological support, and health and behavior interventions) for seriously ill veterans.                  Methods:                    Retrospective review of medical records from 287 seriously ill veterans who received inpatient palliative care consults between 2008 and 2010 in the NY/NJ Veterans Healthcare Network.                  Results:                    Of the veterans who were cognitively or physically able to answer questions on the Condensed Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, 44% reported psychological distress. Of those with distress, 38% accessed mental health care. In logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic and health characteristics, there was no evidence that psychological distress reported during the palliative care consult was associated with subsequent mental health care receipt from any type of provider.                  Conclusions:                    Efforts to increase mental health care to psychologically distressed palliative care patients need to convert assessments into receipt of needed care.          "
lemon balm,Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy in Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial - PubMed,"              Purpose Advanced prostate cancer (PC) is associated with substantial psychosocial morbidity. We sought to determine whether mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) reduces distress in men with advanced PC. Methods Men with advanced PC (proven metastatic and/or castration-resistant biochemical progression) were randomly assigned to an 8-week, group-based MBCT intervention delivered by telephone (n = 94) or to minimally enhanced usual care (n = 95). Primary intervention outcomes were psychological distress, cancer-specific distress, and prostate-specific antigen anxiety. Mindfulness skills were assessed as potential mediators of effect. Participants were assessed at baseline and were followed up at 3, 6, and 9 months. Main statistical analyses were conducted on the basis of intention to treat. Results Fourteen MBCT groups were conducted in the intervention arm. Facilitator adherence ratings were high (> 93%). Using random-effects mixed-regression models, intention-to-treat analyses indicated no significant changes in intervention outcomes or in engagement with mindfulness for men in MBCT compared with those receiving minimally enhanced usual care. Per-protocol analyses also found no differences between arms in outcomes or engagement, with the exception of the mindfulness skill of observing, which increased over time for men in MBCT compared with usual care ( P = .032). Conclusion MBCT in this format was not more effective than minimally enhanced usual care in reducing distress in men with advanced PC. Future intervention research for these men should consider approaches that map more closely to masculinity.          "
lemon balm,GABA-modulating phytomedicines for anxiety: A systematic review of preclinical and clinical evidence - PubMed,"              Anxiety disorders are chronic and functionally disabling conditions with high psychological stress, characterised by cognitive symptoms of excessive worry and focus difficulties and physiological symptoms such as muscle tension and insomnia. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter within the central nervous system and is a key target of pharmacotherapies in the treatment of anxiety. Although current pharmaceutical treatments are often efficacious, they may cause undesirable side effects including cognitive decrements and withdrawal symptoms. Plant-based ""phytomedicines"" may provide novel treatment options, to act as an adjunctive or alternative to existing anxiolytic medications. As such, we conducted a systematic review to assess the current body of literature on anxiolytic phytomedicines and/or phytoconstituents. An open-ended search to 5 July 2017 was conducted using MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, and Cochrane library online databases and performed in a stepped format from preclinical to clinical investigations. Eligible studies must have had (a) in vitro evidence of GABA-modulating activity, (b) animal studies using anxiety models to test an anxiolytic effect, and (c) human clinical trials. Ten phytomedicines were identified as having preclinical investigations showing interaction with the GABA system, in addition to human clinical trials: kava, valerian, pennywort, hops, chamomile, Ginkgo biloba, passionflower, ashwagandha, skullcap, and lemon balm. Collectively, the literature reveals preclinical and clinical evidence for various phytomedicines modulating GABA-pathways, with comparative anxiolytic effect to the current array of pharmaceuticals, along with good safety and tolerability profiles.

lemon balm,Psychological risk factors for cardiac-related hospital readmission within 6 months of coronary artery bypass graft surgery - PubMed,"        Objective:                    The objective of this study was to examine the psychological risk factors for cardiac-related readmission within 6 months of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).                  Methods:                    Consecutive patients awaiting elective CABG (N=119; 100 males and 19 females), with a mean age of 63.3 years, completed a battery of psychosocial measures in a three-stage repeated-measures design. Relevant medical data were also extracted from patients' medical records 6 months postoperatively to allow for the examination of potential covariates.                  Results:                    Two psychological variables, increased postoperative anxiety and increased preoperative depression, were identified as risk factors for cardiac-related readmission independent of the only significant covariate identified, cardiopulmonary bypass time.                  Conclusion:                    Anxiety in the immediate postoperative period and, to a lesser extent, preoperative depression are important determinants of health care utilization postdischarge. Further research to clarify the psychological factors that are predictive of readmission, and that attempt to determine both the underlying cause of readmissions and potential mechanisms through which psychological factors act is recommended. Such research may highlight potential factors to target in interventions and the best time at which to intervene.          "
lemon balm,Diurnal cortisol variation and cortisol response to an MRI stressor in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder - PubMed,"              Markers of HPA axis function, including diurnal cortisol rhythm and cortisol responses to stress or pharmacological manipulation, are increasingly reported as disrupted in schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD). However, there has been no direct comparison of cortisol responses to stress in SZ and BD in the same study, and associations between cortisol dysfunction and illness characteristics remain unclear. In this study we used spline embedded linear mixed models to examine cortisol levels of SZ and BD participants at waking, during the first 45min after waking (representing the cortisol awakening response; CAR), during the period of rapid cortisol decline post the awakening response, and in reaction to a stressor (MRI scan), relative to healthy controls (HC). Contrary to expectations, neither SZ nor BD showed differences in waking cortisol levels, CAR, or immediate post-CAR decline compared to HC; however, waking cortisol levels were greater in BD relative to SZ. In response to the MRI stressor, the SZ group showed a significant absence of the expected increase in cortisol responsivity to stress, which was seen in both the BD and HC groups. Clinical factors affecting the CAR differed between SZ and BD. In SZ, higher antipsychotic medication dosage was associated with a steeper incline of the CAR, while greater positive symptom severity was associated with a more blunted CAR, and greater levels of anxiety were associated with the blunted cortisol response to stress. In BD, longer illness duration was associated with a steeper incline in CAR and lower levels of waking cortisol. These results suggest that cortisol responses may normalize with medication (in SZ) and longer illness duration (in BD), in line with findings of aberrant cortisol levels in the early stages of psychotic disorders.

lemon balm,Improvements in personal resiliency among youth who have completed trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy: A preliminary examination - PubMed,"              This preliminary investigation assessed whether different aspects of personal resiliency improved for youth (7-17 years old) impacted by child sexual abuse (CSA) after completing trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT). The Resiliency Scales for Children and Adolescents (RSCA; Prince-Embury, 2007) were administered to 157 youth before and after participating in TF-CBT with their nonoffending caregivers. Hierarchal regression analyses were performed to ascertain whether pretest RSCA resiliency scores moderated decreases in the posttraumatic stress and self-reported depressive symptoms at posttreatment. The RSCA scales did not moderate any of the improvements on the PTSD and depression outcome measures. Paired t-tests between the mean pre- and posttest RSCA Sense of Mastery (MAS), Sense of Relatedness (REL), and Emotional Reactivity (REA) scores demonstrated significant (ps<0.001) improvements on these measures over time. Using residualized posttest scores for the three RSCA scales to assess improvement, significant correlations were found between changes in resiliency and various residualized outcome scores for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression measures. Decreases in the REA scores and increases in the MAS and REL scores were related to fewer symptoms of hypervigilance and less self-reported depression after completing TF-CBT. Only improvements in the REL scores were associated with fewer symptoms of re-experiencing after treatment. The results were discussed as indicating that significant improvements in personal resiliency had occurred over time with effect sizes less than those found for posttraumatic stress symptoms, but comparable to those found for self-reported depression reductions. Limitations and future research recommendations are discussed.          "
lemon balm,Change Across Time in Cancer-Related Traumatic Stress Symptoms of Siblings of Children with Cancer: A Preliminary Investigation - PubMed,"              This pilot study examined changes in cancer-related post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) across time for siblings of children with cancer. Siblings (N = 32; aged 8-18) completed a measure of anxiety, the Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS), and the PTSD section of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID) at twelve (SD = .9) and eighteen months (SD = 1.3) post-diagnosis. Moderate-to-severe PTSS was reported by 12 siblings (38%) at T1 and 7 (22%) at T2. Cluster analysis of PTSS data revealed five patterns: Few symptoms, stable across time (31%, n = 10); Mild symptoms, decreasing across time (16%, n = 5); Mild, stable symptoms (28%, n = 9); Moderate/severe symptoms, decreasing across time but remaining moderate (19%, n = 6); and Moderate/severe, stable symptoms (6%, n = 2). SCID data and anxiety scores distinguished siblings in the final two clusters from those with more favorable PTSS levels/trajectories. Additional research with larger samples is needed to validate these trajectories and examine factors that distinguish siblings with consistently elevated cancer-related PTSS from those with mild or significantly improving symptoms.

lemon balm,Salivary cortisol reveals overt and hidden anxiety in survivors of childhood cancer attending clinic - PubMed,"        Background:                    Symptoms of anxiety may arise from fear of cancer recurrence and memories of traumatic experiences during treatment. This study aimed to identify changes in mental health and cortisol, a biological marker of stress, associated with oncology surveillance clinic attendance.                  Methods:                    Adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of childhood cancer (aged 12-30 years, N = 46) attending a survivorship clinic were recruited. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, an anxiety self-rating and open answer question, and salivary cortisol collections were completed two weeks before and one day before clinic, on clinic day and two weeks after.                  Results:                    Trait anxiety scores were consistent with the normal population. State anxiety scores two weeks after clinic were significantly lower than baseline (p = 0.02). Cortisol diurnal slopes were flatter than baseline after clinic (p = 0.02). Evening cortisol levels were significantly higher than baseline two weeks post clinic (p = 0.02).                  Limitations:                    Combined results from biological and psychometric assessments can be difficult to interpret. Larger cohorts will further delineate cortisol pathway activity and distress in AYA cancer survivors.                  Conclusions:                    Psychometric evidence indicates that AYA survivors of childhood cancer perceive themselves to be less anxious after a survivorship clinic visit. Biological evidence, however, indicates a dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis which may be linked to clinic attendance. Weak correlations suggest that cortisol may not be a reliable indicator of self-perceived anxiety. This may be due to confounding lifestyle factors influencing the stress response or potential 'coping strategies' developed during past treatment experience which may, hypothetically, have masked self-perceived anxiety.

lemon balm,Physical activity and cognitive changes in younger women after breast cancer treatment - PubMed,"        Objectives:                    Studies indicate women aged 25-49 years previously treated for cancer report cognitive alterations. Good evidence indicates physical activity can be beneficial after cancer and might additionally benefit cognitive function. This short report presents data from a substudy of the Younger Women's Wellness after Cancer Program (YWWACP), which explored cognitive alterations and investigated potential associations between physical activity and cognitive function in participants in the YWWACP. The primary aim of this substudy was to determine in younger women previously treated for breast cancer (1) whether subjectively reported cognitive function changed over time and (2) if physical activity is associated with subjectively reported cognitive function, and if time had an impact on this.                  Methods:                    All participants had completed breast cancer treatment. Data were collected at baseline (n=41) and at 12 weeks. Measures assessed demographics, self-reported physical activity, cognitive function, sleep quality, stress, anxiety and depression using validated and reliable, subjectively reported instruments.                  Results:                    Cognitive function and physical activity scores increased across the time points, with cognitive function revealing a statistically significant increase over time (p=0.004). Statistical testing revealed that physical activity was not correlated with cognitive function and that change in physical activity was not correlated with change in cognitive function.                  Conclusion:                    These data provide early evidence that cognitive function and physical activity improved over time in this sample. However, interpretations of a correlation between physical activity and cognitive function should be made with caution, and future research would benefit from larger samples.          "
lemon balm,Intradialytic Laughter Yoga therapy for haemodialysis patients: a pre-post intervention feasibility study - PubMed,"        Background:                    Laughter Yoga consists of physical exercise, relaxation techniques and simulated vigorous laughter. It has been associated with physical and psychological benefits for people in diverse clinical and non-clinical settings, but has not yet been tested in a haemodialysis setting. The study had three aims: 1) to examine the feasibility of conducting Laughter Yoga for patients with end stage kidney disease in a dialysis setting; 2) to explore the psychological and physiological impact of Laughter Yoga for these patients; and 3) to estimate the sample size required for future research.                  Methods:                    Pre/post intervention feasibility study. Eighteen participants were recruited into the study and Laughter Yoga therapists provided a four week intradialytic program (30-min intervention three times per week). Primary outcomes were psychological items measured at the first and last Laughter Yoga session, including: quality of life; subjective wellbeing; mood; optimism; control; self-esteem; depression, anxiety and stress. Secondary outcomes were: blood pressure, intradialytic hypotensive episodes and lung function (forced expiratory volume). Dialysis nurses exposed to the intervention completed a Laughter Yoga attitudes and perceptions survey (n = 11). Data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics v22, including descriptive and inferential statistics, and sample size estimates were calculated using G*Power.                  Results:                    One participant withdrew from the study for medical reasons that were unrelated to the study during the first week (94 % retention rate). There were non-significant increases in happiness, mood, and optimism and a decrease in stress. Episodes of intradialytic hypotension decreased from 19 pre and 19 during Laughter Yoga to 4 post Laughter Yoga. There was no change in lung function or blood pressure. All nurses agreed or strongly agreed that Laughter Yoga had a positive impact on patients' mood, it was a feasible intervention and they would recommend Laughter Yoga to their patients. Sample size calculations for future research indicated that a minimum of 207 participants would be required to provide sufficient power to detect change in key psychological variables.                  Conclusions:                    This study provides evidence that Laughter Yoga is a safe, low-intensity form of intradialytic physical activity that can be successfully implemented for patients in dialysis settings. Larger studies are required, however, to determine the effect of Laughter Yoga on key psychological variables.

lemon balm,Availability of Emotional Support and Mental Health Care for Pediatric Residents - PubMed,"        Objective:                    Resident mental health (MH) problems can be associated with reduced empathy and increased medical errors. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education mandates resident MH support services, but it is unknown if these services are accessible and meet resident needs. We sought to describe the prevalence of anxiety and depression in current pediatric residents in New York State (NYS), and their self-reported use of and barriers to support services.                  Methods:                    We developed an online survey and distributed it to all categorical pediatric residents in 9 NYS programs. Items addressing self-concern for clinical anxiety and depression and use of MH services were pilot tested for content and construct validity. The validated Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) measured depressive symptoms. Analyses used descriptive and chi-square tests.                  Results:                    Respondents included 227 residents (54% response rate) distributed across training levels and programs. Many reported ""often"" or ""almost always"" feeling stress (52%), physical exhaustion (41%), and mental exhaustion (35%); 11% had PHQ-2-defined depressive symptoms. Some thought that their stress levels raised concern for clinical depression (25%) or anxiety (28%); among these, only 44% and 39%, respectively, had sought care. More women reported physical exhaustion (P < .05). Only 45% of residents reported educational offerings on resident MH; 66% wanted to know more about available resources. Barriers to receipt of services included inflexible schedules (82%), guilt about burdening colleagues (65%), fear of confidentiality breach (46%), and difficulty identifying services (44%).                  Conclusions:                    Pediatric residents frequently experience MH symptoms, but many do not know about or use support services. Programs should enhance MH support by overcoming barriers and increasing resident awareness of services.          "
lemon balm,Cannabidiol and Sports Performance: a Narrative Review of Relevant Evidence and Recommendations for Future Research - PubMed,"              Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-intoxicating cannabinoid derived from Cannabis sativa. CBD initially drew scientific interest due to its anticonvulsant properties but increasing evidence of other therapeutic effects has attracted the attention of additional clinical and non-clinical populations, including athletes. Unlike the intoxicating cannabinoid, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), CBD is no longer prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency and appears to be safe and well-tolerated in humans. It has also become readily available in many countries with the introduction of over-the-counter ""nutraceutical"" products. The aim of this narrative review was to explore various physiological and psychological effects of CBD that may be relevant to the sport and/or exercise context and to identify key areas for future research. As direct studies of CBD and sports performance are is currently lacking, evidence for this narrative review was sourced from preclinical studies and a limited number of clinical trials in non-athlete populations. Preclinical studies have observed robust anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and analgesic effects of CBD in animal models. Preliminary preclinical evidence also suggests that CBD may protect against gastrointestinal damage associated with inflammation and promote healing of traumatic skeletal injuries. However, further research is required to confirm these observations. Early stage clinical studies suggest that CBD may be anxiolytic in ""stress-inducing"" situations and in individuals with anxiety disorders. While some case reports indicate that CBD improves sleep, robust evidence is currently lacking. Cognitive function and thermoregulation appear to be unaffected by CBD while effects on food intake, metabolic function, cardiovascular function, and infection require further study. CBD may exert a number of physiological, biochemical, and psychological effects with the potential to benefit athletes. However, well controlled, studies in athlete populations are required before definitive conclusions can be reached regarding the utility of CBD in supporting athletic performance.          "
lemon balm,"The class-dimensional structure of PTSD before and after deployment to Iraq: Evidence from direct comparison of dimensional, categorical, and hybrid models - PubMed","              The assumption of specific etiology in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) differentiates the disorder from most other psychiatric conditions. A 'risky test' of the assumption of specific etiology and resultant trauma-related symptom dimensions was conducted through structural modeling of PTSD symptoms in soldiers before (N=522) and after (n=423) a combat deployment to Iraq. If PTSD represents a discrete diagnostic entity that emerges after trauma exposure, we hypothesized either the number of latent classes should increase from pre- to post-deployment or symptom dimensions should qualitatively distinguish affected from unaffected classes following trauma exposure. Comparison of latent structural models revealed best fitting hybrid models for PTSD and depression with strong invariance of symptom dimensions across classes both before and after deployment and only quantitative (i.e., severity) differences between classes. These findings suggest PTSD is generally well-conceptualized as a dimensional syndrome worsened but not necessarily elicited by trauma exposure.           "
lemon balm,Efficacy of yoga for depressed postpartum women: A randomized controlled trial - PubMed,"        Background:                    Up to 20% of women experience postpartum depression (PPD). PPD is associated with anxiety and poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Efficacious treatments are critical; many women with PPD prefer complementary therapies. Thus, the current study examined yoga as a complementary therapy for PPD.                  Methods:                    Fifty-seven postpartum women with scores ≥12 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were randomly assigned to a yoga (N = 28) or wait-list control (N = 29) group. The yoga intervention consisted of 16 classes over 8 weeks. Outcomes were depression, anxiety, and HRQOL.                  Results:                    The yoga group experienced significantly greater rate of improvement in depression, anxiety, and HRQOL, relative to the control group with moderate to large effects. Reliable Change Index analyses revealed that 78% of women in the yoga group experienced clinically significant change.

lemon balm,"Plant-based medicines for anxiety disorders, part 2: a review of clinical studies with supporting preclinical evidence - PubMed","              Research in the area of herbal psychopharmacology has revealed a variety of promising medicines that may provide benefit in the treatment of general anxiety and specific anxiety disorders. However, a comprehensive review of plant-based anxiolytics has been absent to date. Thus, our aim was to provide a comprehensive narrative review of plant-based medicines that have clinical and/or preclinical evidence of anxiolytic activity. We present the article in two parts. In part one, we reviewed herbal medicines for which only preclinical investigations for anxiolytic activity have been performed. In this current article (part two), we review herbal medicines for which there have been both preclinical and clinical investigations of anxiolytic activity. A search of MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, Scopus and the Cochrane Library databases was conducted (up to 28 October 2012) for English language papers using the search terms 'anxiety' OR 'anxiety disorder' OR 'generalized anxiety disorder' OR 'social phobia' OR 'post-traumatic stress disorder' OR 'panic disorder' OR 'agoraphobia' OR 'obsessive compulsive disorder' in combination with the search terms 'Herb*' OR 'Medicinal Plants' OR 'Botanical Medicine' OR 'Chinese herb*', in addition to individual herbal medicines. This search of the literature revealed 1,525 papers, of which 53 plants were included in the review (having at least one study using the whole plant extract). Of these plants, 21 had human clinical trial evidence (reviewed here in part two), with the other 32 having solely preclinical evidence (reviewed in part one). Support for efficacy was found for chronic use (i.e. greater than one day) of the following herbs in treating a range of anxiety disorders in human clinical trials: Piper methysticum, Matricaria recutita, Ginkgo biloba, Scutellaria lateriflora, Silybum marianum, Passiflora incarnata, Withania somniferum, Galphimia glauca, Centella asiatica, Rhodiola rosea, Echinacea spp., Melissa officinalis and Echium amoenum. For several of the plants studied, conclusions need to be tempered due to methodological issues such as small sample sizes, brief intervention durations and non-replication. Current evidence does not support Hypericum perforatum or Valeriana spp. for any anxiety disorder. Acute anxiolytic activity was found for Centella asiatica, Salvia spp., Melissa officinalis, Passiflora incarnata and Citrus aurantium. Bacopa monnieri has shown anxiolytic effects in people with cognitive decline. The therapeutic application of psychotropic plant-based treatments for anxiety disorders is also discussed, specifically Psychotria viridis and Banisteriopsis caarti (ayahuasca), Psilocybe spp. and cannabidiol-enriched (low tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC)) Cannabis spp.          "
lemon balm,"Effect of the fixed combination of valerian, lemon balm, passionflower, and butterbur extracts (Ze 185) on the prescription pattern of benzodiazepines in hospitalized psychiatric patients-A retrospective case-control investigation - PubMed","              Stress is an increasing problem that can result in various psychiatric and somatoform symptoms. Among others, benzodiazepines and valerian preparations are used to treat stress symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the prescription of a fixed herbal extract combination of valerian, lemon balm, passionflower, and butterbur (Ze 185) changes the prescription pattern of benzodiazepines in hospitalized psychiatric patients. In a retrospective case-control study, anonymized medical record data from 3,252 psychiatric in-house patients were analysed over a 3.5-year period. Cases (n = 1,548) with a prescription of Ze 185 and controls (n = 1,704) were matched by age, gender, hospitalization interval, and main International Classification of Diseases, Version 10 F-diagnoses. The primary objective was to investigate the effect of Ze 185 on the prescription pattern of benzodiazepines. Secondary objectives investigated the prescriptions of concomitant drugs and effectiveness of the hospital stay. Distribution of drug classes was analysed using the WHO's anatomic-therapeutic-chemical code. Data showed that both treatment modalities had a comparable clinical effectiveness but with significantly less prescriptions of benzodiazepines in the Ze 185 group (p = .006). This is of clinical importance because suitable alternatives to benzodiazepines are desirable. To obtain more support for this hypothesis, a dedicated randomized, controlled clinical trial monitoring drug safety is required.          "
lemon balm,Childhood psychological problems in school settings in rural Southern Africa - PubMed,"        Background:                    Many children can be exposed to multiple adversities in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) placing them at potential risk of psychological problems. However, there is a paucity of research using large representative cohorts examining the psychological adjustment of children in school settings in these countries. Children's psychological adjustment has been shown to affect educational progress which is critical for their future. This study, based in a rural, socio-economically disadvantaged area of South Africa, aimed to examine the prevalence of children's psychological problems as well as possible risk and protective factors.                  Methods:                    Rates of psychological problems in 10-12 year olds were examined using teacher- and child-report questionnaires. Data on children from 10 rural primary schools, selected by stratified random sampling, were linked to individual and household data from the Agincourt health and socio-demographic surveillance system collected from households over 15 years.                  Results:                    A total of 1,025 children were assessed. Teachers identified high levels of behavioural and emotional problems (41%). Children reported lower, but substantial rates of anxiety/depression (14%), and significant post-traumatic stress symptoms (24%); almost a quarter felt unsafe in school. Risk factors included being a second-generation former refugee and being from a large household. Protective factors highlight the importance of maternal factors, such as being more educated and in a stable partnership.                  Conclusion:                    The high levels of psychological problems identified by teachers are a serious public health concern, as they are likely to impact negatively on children's education, particularly given the large class sizes and limited resources in rural LMIC settings. Despite the high levels of risk, a proportion of children were managing well and research to understand resilience could inform interventions.          "
lemon balm,Learning and memory in rape victims with posttraumatic stress disorder - PubMed,"        Objective:                    Studies have shown memory deficits among combat veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however, high rates of comorbid conditions, including alcoholism, make it difficult to definitively associate these findings with the PTSD diagnosis. In this study the authors examined memory functioning among rape survivors without alcoholism or substance abuse but with PTSD.                  Method:                    Rape victims with (N = 15) and without (N = 16) PTSD were compared to age- and education-matched nontraumatized comparison subjects (N = 16) on measures of learning and memory.                  Results:                    The subjects with PTSD performed significantly worse than the other groups on delayed free recall. The deficits were ameliorated by cueing and recognition testing.                  Conclusions:                    Recall deficits in noncombat PTSD patients strengthen the theory that memory deficits are associated with the PTSD diagnosis. The deficits were mild and were not attributable to comorbid depression, anxiety, or substance abuse.          "
lemon balm,The herbal extract ALS-L1023 from Melissa officinalis alleviates visceral obesity and insulin resistance in obese female C57BL/6J mice - PubMed,"        Ethnopharmacological relevance:                    Melissa officinalis L. (Labiatae; lemon balm) has traditionally been used as a medicinal herb to treat stress, anxiety, and insomnia. Current reports suggest that not only chronic stress stimulates angiogenesis, but angiogenesis also regulates adipogenesis and obesity. Because the herbal extract ALS-L1023 from Melissa officinalis inhibits angiogenesis, we hypothesized that ALS-L1023 could suppress visceral obesity and insulin resistance in obese female C57BL/6J mice, a mouse model of obese premenopausal women.                  Materials and methods:                    The mice were grouped and fed for 16 weeks as follows: 1) low-fat diet (LFD), 2) high-fat diet (HFD), or 3) HFD supplemented with 0.4 or 0.8% ALS-L1023. Variables and determinants of visceral obesity, insulin resistance, and pancreatic dysfunction were then assessed via blood analysis, histology, immunohistochemistry, and real-time polymerase chain reaction.                  Results:                    ALS-L1023 decreased weight gain, visceral adipocyte size, and serum lipid levels in HFD-fed obese mice. ALS-L1023 also normalized hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia and concomitantly reduced blood glucose levels during oral glucose tolerance tests. The pancreatic islet size and insulin-positive β-cell area were significantly reduced in ALS-L1023-treated mice compared with untreated obese controls, reaching a level similar to that of LFD-fed lean mice. ALS-L1023 suppressed pancreatic lipid accumulation, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and collagen levels. ALS-L1023 treatment altered the pancreatic expression of genes involved in steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis.                  Conclusions:                    Our findings indicate that the herbal extract ALS-L1023 from Melissa officinalis not only inhibits visceral obesity, but also attenuates the increased fasting blood glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and pancreatic dysfunction seen in female obese mice. These results suggest that ALS-L1023 may be effective in the prevention of visceral obesity and insulin resistance in obese premenopausal women.          "
lemon balm,Melissa officinalis L. hydro-alcoholic extract inhibits anxiety and depression through prevention of central oxidative stress and apoptosis - PubMed,"        New findings:                    What is the central question of this study? How does an extract of Melissa officinalis L. ameliorate anxiety- and depressive-like behaviour of mice? What is the main finding and its importance? An extract of Melissa officinalis L. possessed anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects, which could mainly be mediated through its antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties.                  Abstract:                    This study evaluated the effects of a hydro-alcoholic extract of Melissa officinalis (HAEMO) on anxiety- and depressive-like behaviours, oxidative stress and apoptosis markers in restraint stress-exposed mice. In order to induce a depression-like model, mice were subjected to restraint stress (3 h day-1 for 14 days) and received normal saline or HAEMO (50, 75 and 150 mg kg-1 day-1 ) for 14 days. The administered doses of HAEMO were designated based on the concentration of one of the main phenolic compounds present in the extract, rosmarinic acid (2.55 mg kg-1 at lowest dose); other phytochemical analyses including assays for antioxidant activity, total phenols and flavonoids were also carried out. The behavioural changes in an open field task, elevated plus maze, tail suspension and forced swimming tests were evaluated. Also, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, and total antioxidant capacity were assessed in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, levels of Bcl-2, Bax and caspase 3 in the brain as well as serum concentration of corticosterone were evaluated. HAEMO (75 and 150 mg kg-1 ) significantly reversed anxiety- and depressive-like behaviours. Also, HAEMO reduced MDA levels, enhanced enzymatic antioxidant activities and restored serum levels of corticosterone. An immunoblotting analysis also demonstrated that HAEMO decreased levels of pro-apoptotic markers and increased anti-apoptotic protein levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of restraint stress-exposed mice. Our findings suggested that HAEMO reduced inflammation and had anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in mice.          "
lemon balm,Discriminatory power of a 25-item distress screening tool: a cross-sectional survey of 251 cancer survivors - PubMed,"        Objective:                    The objective was to test the discriminatory power of a 25-item distress screening tool for use among cancer survivors. We used a measure of item discrimination to determine which items perform better than others at identifying those at greatest risk of distress.                  Methods:                    A total of 251 members (90 % female, median age 57 years) of a community-based cancer support organization completed a web-based distress screening tool. Participants were asked to rate each of 25 items according to the question ""Today, how concerned are you about…?"" using a five-point Likert scale (0 not at all to 4 very seriously concerned). An overall distress score was calculated as the sum of items rated at or above two for somewhat concerned. Participants were categorized as high scorers (≥13, n = 59) and low scorers (≤4, n = 60). The item discrimination index (IDI) was calculated for each item as the percentage difference in concerned (somewhat or greater) responses between high and low scorers.                  Results:                    Items with the greatest discriminatory power (IDI ≥0.8) were as follows: changes or disruptions in work, school or home life; feeling sad or depressed; feeling too tired to do the things you need or want to do; worrying about the future and what lies ahead; and feeling nervous or afraid. Conversely, items with the lowest IDI included considering taking your own life; eating and nutrition; tobacco or substance use; and transportation to treatment and appointments.                  Conclusion:                    The results highlight, among 25 items of a community-based distress screening tool, items with the greatest discriminatory power to identify cancer survivors with psychosocial distress. Results suggest targeted screening items to identify those most at risk for distress and priority areas for support services.          "

The present study examines the effects of a fixed combination of valerian, passion flower, lemon balm, and butterbur extracts (Ze 185) on biological and affective responses to a standardized psychosocial stress paradigm.                  Purpose:                    The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of Ze 185 on cortisol and anxiety stress responses to acute psychosocial stress in healthy subjects.                  Study design:                    This study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind study with 3 parallel groups.                  Methods:                    72 healthy male participants were randomized to 3 groups (Ze 185, placebo or no treatment) during 4 days prior to a standardized psychosocial stress paradigm. Principle outcomes were salivary cortisol and self-reported anxiety responses to stress assessed at the fourth day.                  Results:                    The stress paradigm induced significant and large cortisol and self-reported anxiety responses. Groups did not differ significantly in their salivary cortisol response to stress, but participants in the Ze 185 condition showed significantly attenuated responses in self-reported anxiety in comparison to placebo (F(3, 41) = 3.33, p = 0.03) and no treatment (F(3, 43) = 2.77, p = 0.05).                  Conclusion:                    The results show that Ze 185 significantly attenuated the subjective emotional stress response during an acute stress situation, without affecting biological stress responses. Given that a circumscribed biological stress response is to be considered as an adaptive mechanism, Ze 185 reduces self-reported anxiety response to stress without affecting assumingly adaptive biological stress responses.

lemon balm,Applying attachment theory to indecisiveness in hoarding disorder - PubMed,"              Research shows that individuals who experience distress when discarding their possessions are more indecisive than individuals who do not experience such difficulty. These individuals report more intense emotional responses and greater intolerance to distress when faced with a discarding task. The aim of this study was to determine whether an insecure attachment style contributes to indecisiveness among individuals with discarding difficulties and whether this association is mediated by emotional reactivity and distress intolerance. This study used a within-group cross-sectional design. One hundred fifty-six participants with clinically significant discarding problems (82.7% female; Mean age = 21.96, SD = 7.38) from a population of university students and community members completed self-report questionnaires that assessed severity of hoarding behaviours, insecure attachment styles, emotional reactivity, distress intolerance, and indecisiveness. Analyses revealed that an anxious attachment style was associated with greater indecisiveness, and this relationship was mediated by emotional reactivity, but not distress intolerance. Furthermore, avoidant attachment was not related to indecisiveness. Clinical interventions should consider the role of attachment styles in hoarding disorder and address emotional reactivity difficulties in treatment through the use of discarding exposures, as emotion plays an important role in these decision-making processes.

Passionflower,Passiflora for anxiety disorder - PubMed,"        Background:                    Anxiety is a very common mental health problem in the general population and in the primary care setting. Herbal medicines are popularly used worldwide and could be an option for treating anxiety if shown to be effective and safe. Passiflora (passionflower extract) is one of these compounds.                  Objectives:                    To investigate the effectiveness and safety of passiflora for treating any anxiety disorder.                  Search strategy:                    The following sources were used: electronic databases: Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR-Studies), Medline and Lilacs; Cross-checking references; contact with authors of included studies and manufacturers of passiflora.                  Selection criteria:                    Relevant randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of passiflora using any dose, regime, or method of administration for people with any primary diagnosis of general anxiety disorder, anxiety neurosis, chronic anxiety status or any other mental health disorder in which anxiety is a core symptom (panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, social phobia, agoraphobia, other types of phobia, postraumatic stress disorder). Effectiveness was measured using clinical outcome measures such as Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and other scales for anxiety symptoms.                  Data collection and analysis:                    Two reviewers independently selected the trials found through the search strategy, extracted data, performed the trial quality analyses and entered data. Where any disagreements occured, the third reviewer was consulted. Methodological quality of the trials included in this review was assessed using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook. For dichotomous outcomes, relative risk with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated, and for continuous outcomes, weighted mean difference with 95%CI was used.                  Main results:                    Two studies, with a total of 198 participants, were eligible for inclusion in this review. Based on one study, a lack of difference in the efficacy of benzodiazepines and passiflora was indicated. Dropout rates were similar between the two interventions. Although the findings from one study suggested an improvement in job performance in favour of passiflora (post-hoc outcome) and one study showed a lower rate of drowsiness as a side effect with passiflora as compared with mexazolam, neither of these findings reached statistical significance.                  Authors' conclusions:                    RCTs examining the effectiveness of passiflora for anxiety are too few in number to permit any conclusions to be drawn. RCTs with larger samples that compare the effectiveness of passiflora with placebo and other types of medication, including antidepressants, are needed.          "
Passionflower,Formulations of dietary supplements and herbal extracts for relaxation and anxiolytic action: Relarian - PubMed,"              Dietary supplements are widely used for desired effects on memory, insomnia, mood and anxiety. This review focuses on supplements which have anxiolytic or mild relaxation properties and enhance mood. For example, Kava (Piper methysticum) is reported to have anaxiolytic actions and to reduce tension through skeletal muscle relaxation. Dried passion flower (genus Passiflora) is reported to reduce insomnia and hysteria. Skullcap (genus Scutellaria), hops (Humulus lupulus), lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) and Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) root are all herbs reported as anaxiolytic calming agents. Further, extracts of Magnolia and Phellondendron bark are mild sedatives. Supplements such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), theanine, tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) are reported to promote relaxation. In general, these supplements appear to act as GABA receptor agonists or to boost GABA levels, although Kava inhibits both norephinephrine uptake and sodium and potassium channels and 5-HTP may act through elevation of serotonin. While questions remain in the literature regarding the medicinal value of these supplements in treating mood and anxiety disorders, based on cellular and animal studies as well as human clinical trials the literature supports a role for these preparations as useful alternatives in the management of the stress and anxiety of everyday life.

Passionflower,GABA-modulating phytomedicines for anxiety: A systematic review of preclinical and clinical evidence - PubMed,"              Anxiety disorders are chronic and functionally disabling conditions with high psychological stress, characterised by cognitive symptoms of excessive worry and focus difficulties and physiological symptoms such as muscle tension and insomnia. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter within the central nervous system and is a key target of pharmacotherapies in the treatment of anxiety. Although current pharmaceutical treatments are often efficacious, they may cause undesirable side effects including cognitive decrements and withdrawal symptoms. Plant-based ""phytomedicines"" may provide novel treatment options, to act as an adjunctive or alternative to existing anxiolytic medications. As such, we conducted a systematic review to assess the current body of literature on anxiolytic phytomedicines and/or phytoconstituents. An open-ended search to 5 July 2017 was conducted using MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, and Cochrane library online databases and performed in a stepped format from preclinical to clinical investigations. Eligible studies must have had (a) in vitro evidence of GABA-modulating activity, (b) animal studies using anxiety models to test an anxiolytic effect, and (c) human clinical trials. Ten phytomedicines were identified as having preclinical investigations showing interaction with the GABA system, in addition to human clinical trials: kava, valerian, pennywort, hops, chamomile, Ginkgo biloba, passionflower, ashwagandha, skullcap, and lemon balm. Collectively, the literature reveals preclinical and clinical evidence for various phytomedicines modulating GABA-pathways, with comparative anxiolytic effect to the current array of pharmaceuticals, along with good safety and tolerability profiles.

Passionflower,"Passiflora incarnata L. Improves Spatial Memory, Reduces Stress, and Affects Neurotransmission in Rats - PubMed","              Passiflora incarnata L. has been used as a medicinal plant in South America and Europe since the 16th century. Previous pharmacological studies focused mainly on the plant's sedative, anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant effects on the central nervous system and its supporting role in the treatment of addiction. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the behavioral and neurochemical effects of long-term oral administration of P. incarnata. The passionflower extract (30, 100, or 300 mg/kg body weight/day) was given to 4-week-old male Wistar rats via their drinking water. Tests were conducted after 7 weeks of treatment. Spatial memory was assessed in a water maze, and the levels of amino acids, monoamines, and their metabolites were evaluated in select brain regions by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). We observed reduced anxiety and dose-dependent improvement of memory in rats given passionflower compared to the control group. In addition, hippocampal glutamic acid and cortical serotonin content were depleted, with increased levels of metabolites and increased turnover. Thus, our results partially confirmed the proposed mechanism of action of P. incarnata involving GABAA receptors. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.           "
Passionflower,"Assessment of sedative effects of Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa and Passiflora alata extracts in mice, measured by telemetry - PubMed","              Several Passiflora species have been used widely as a folk medicine due to their sedative and anxiolytic activities. In Brazil, a number of native plants of the genus Passiflora exist, but only Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa (PE) and Passiflora alata (PA) are of commercial value. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the sedative effects of aqueous extracts obtained from the pericarp as well as from the leaves of PE and PA in mice using radiotelemetry. Aqueous extracts from PE and PA were tested for effects on locomotion over 180 min in 300 mg/kg, 600 mg/kg and 1200 mg/kg, in male C57BL/6J mice after oral administration. For validation of the telemetry system, caffeine (negative control) and midazolam (positive control) were used. All tested extracts decreased locomotor activity in a dose-dependent manner in comparison to the control group. The two lower concentrations of each extract showed the highest decrease in locomotion after 24 min, while 1200 mg/kg had a significant sedative effect already after 18 min. Interestingly, aqueous extracts of PA were more active in comparison to aqueous extracts of PE and the pericarp extracts of both plants showed more pronounced effects on locomotor activity if compared to leaf extracts. In conclusion, the present study represents an innovative, objective approach to measure sedative effects of plant extracts with minimized handling-related stress and remote data collection.

Valerian,Valerian for anxiety disorders - PubMed,"        Background:                    Anxiety disorders are very common mental health problems in the general population and in primary care settings. Herbal medicines are popular and used worldwide and might be considered as a treatment option for anxiety if shown to be effective and safe.                  Objectives:                    To investigate the effectiveness and safety of valerian for treating anxiety disorders.                  Search strategy:                    Electronic searches: The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) searched on 04/08/2006, MEDLINE, Lilacs. References of all identified studies were inspected for additional studies. First authors of each included study, manufacturers of valerian products, and experts in the field were contacted for information regarding unpublished trials.                  Selection criteria:                    Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials of valerian extract of any dose, regime, or method of administration, for people with any primary diagnosis of general anxiety disorder, anxiety neurosis, chronic anxiety status, or any other disorder in which anxiety is the primary symptom (panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, social phobia, agoraphobia, other types of phobia, postraumatic stress disorder). Effectiveness was measured using clinical outcome measures and other scales for anxiety symptoms.                  Data collection and analysis:                    Two review authors independently applied inclusion criteria, extracted and entered data, and performed the trial quality assessments. Where disagreements occurred, the third review author was consulted. Methodological quality of included trials was assessed using Cochrane Handbook criteria. For dichotomous outcomes, relative risk (RR) was calculated, and for continuous outcomes, the weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated, with their respective 95% confidence intervals.                  Main results:                    One RCT involving 36 patients wih generalised anxiety disorder was eligible for inclusion. This was a 4 week pilot study of valerian, diazepam and placebo. There were no significant differences between the valerian and placebo groups in HAM-A total scores, or in somatic and psychic factor scores. Similarly, there were no significant differences in HAM-A scores between the valerian and diazepam groups, although based on STAI-Trait scores, significantly greater symptom improvement was indicated in the diazepam group. There were no significant differences between the three groups in the number of patients reporting side effects or in dropout rates.                  Authors' conclusions:                    Since only one small study is currently available, there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the efficacy or safety of valerian compared with placebo or diazepam for anxiety disorders. RCTs involving larger samples and comparing valerian with placebo or other interventions used to treat of anxiety disorders, such as antidepressants, are needed.          "
Valerian,Anxiolytic effects of a combination of Melissa officinalis and Valeriana officinalis during laboratory induced stress - PubMed,"        Objective:                    Melissa officinalis (lemon balm) and Valeriana officinalis (valerian) have been used both traditionally and contemporaneously as mild sedatives, anxiolytics and hypnotics. Recent research has suggested that both may attenuate laboratory induced stress. As the two herbs are most often sold in combination with each other the current study assessed the anxiolytic properties of such a combination during laboratory-induced stress.                  Methods:                    In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, balanced cross-over experiment, 24 healthy volunteers received three separate single doses (600 mg, 1200 mg, 1800 mg) of a standardized product containing M. officinalis and V. officinalis extracts, plus a placebo, on separate days separated by a 7 day wash out period. Modulation of mood and anxiety were assessed during pre-dose and 1 h, 3 h and 6 h post-dose completions of a 20 min version of the Defined Intensity Stressor Simulation (DISS) battery. Cognitive performance on the four concurrent tasks of the battery was also assessed.                  Results:                    The results showed that the 600 mg dose of the combination ameliorated the negative effects of the DISS on ratings of anxiety. However, the highest dose (1800 mg) showed an increase in anxiety that was less marked but which reached significance during one testing session. In addition, all three doses led to decrements in performance on the Stroop task module within the battery, and the two lower doses led to decrements on the overall score generated on the DISS battery.                  Conclusions:                    These results suggest that a combination of Melissa officinalis and Valeriana officinalis possesses anxiolytic properties that deserve further investigation.

Valerian,The effect of valeric on anxiety severity in women undergoing hysterosalpingography - PubMed,"        Aim & scope:                    Hysterosalpingography (HSG) is the radiographic evaluation of the uterine cavity and fallopian tubes, which is generally assumed as a stressful and painful procedure. This study aims to determine effect of oral Valeric capsules on anxiety severity in women under Hysterosalpingography.                  Method & examination:                    This study, as a double-blind clinical trial, was conducted on 64 infertile women undergoing hysterosalpingography, who referred to radiology ward at Comprehensive Women's hospital. To measure anxiety, visual analog anxiety scale was used 90 minutes before starting procedure, individuals in intervention group (n=32) received a single dose (1,500 mg) of 3 Valeric capsules, together with routine prophylaxy, where routine prophylaxis contains Mefenamic acid 250mg capsules in 30 minutes before procedure, and the same capsules were prescribed to placebo group (n=32) with the same instruction. Anxiety severity before and once 90 minutes after intervention in both groups were measured and compared.                  Results:                    There was no difference on anxiety severity before intervention in both groups (p=0.26), and the groups were homogeneous; after intervention, a significant difference on anxiety severity was reported in both groups (p<0/0001), and anxiety score in intervention group compared to placebo reduced statistically.                  Conclusion:                    Present study indicated that Valeric was effective on reducing anxiety in women undergoing hysterosalpingography.          "
Valerian,"Effect of the fixed combination of valerian, lemon balm, passionflower, and butterbur extracts (Ze 185) on the prescription pattern of benzodiazepines in hospitalized psychiatric patients-A retrospective case-control investigation - PubMed","              Stress is an increasing problem that can result in various psychiatric and somatoform symptoms. Among others, benzodiazepines and valerian preparations are used to treat stress symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the prescription of a fixed herbal extract combination of valerian, lemon balm, passionflower, and butterbur (Ze 185) changes the prescription pattern of benzodiazepines in hospitalized psychiatric patients. In a retrospective case-control study, anonymized medical record data from 3,252 psychiatric in-house patients were analysed over a 3.5-year period. Cases (n = 1,548) with a prescription of Ze 185 and controls (n = 1,704) were matched by age, gender, hospitalization interval, and main International Classification of Diseases, Version 10 F-diagnoses. The primary objective was to investigate the effect of Ze 185 on the prescription pattern of benzodiazepines. Secondary objectives investigated the prescriptions of concomitant drugs and effectiveness of the hospital stay. Distribution of drug classes was analysed using the WHO's anatomic-therapeutic-chemical code. Data showed that both treatment modalities had a comparable clinical effectiveness but with significantly less prescriptions of benzodiazepines in the Ze 185 group (p = .006). This is of clinical importance because suitable alternatives to benzodiazepines are desirable. To obtain more support for this hypothesis, a dedicated randomized, controlled clinical trial monitoring drug safety is required.          "
Valerian,Valerian extract alters functional brain connectivity: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial - PubMed,"              Valerian root is the most commonly used herbal supplement for sedation and anxiolysis, but it is unknown whether it may affect functional brain connectivity. Our goal was to use electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate whether valerian root extract (VRE) affects resting-state connectivity changes and whether such changes are associated with clinical symptoms. This 4-week, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted with 64 nonclinical volunteers suffering psychological stress. The participants received VRE (100 mg) or a placebo thrice daily. We examined VRE's therapeutic effects on anxiety and stress-related psychological constructs. Functional brain connectivity changes were measured as EEG coherence in the alpha and theta frequency bands. The VRE and placebo groups both exhibited significant postintervention improvements on all clinical scales, but no significant between-group differences in these changes were noted. Compared with the placebo group, the VRE group exhibited significantly greater increases in frontal brain region alpha coherence across four electrode pairs, and these changes were significantly correlated with anxiolysis. The VRE group also exhibited significantly greater decreases in theta coherence across another four electrodes pairs. Our findings indicate that VRE alters functional brain connectivity in relation to anxiety. Further EEG studies are needed to confirm VRE's neurophysiological effects.          "
Valerian,Formulations of dietary supplements and herbal extracts for relaxation and anxiolytic action: Relarian - PubMed,"              Dietary supplements are widely used for desired effects on memory, insomnia, mood and anxiety. This review focuses on supplements which have anxiolytic or mild relaxation properties and enhance mood. For example, Kava (Piper methysticum) is reported to have anaxiolytic actions and to reduce tension through skeletal muscle relaxation. Dried passion flower (genus Passiflora) is reported to reduce insomnia and hysteria. Skullcap (genus Scutellaria), hops (Humulus lupulus), lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) and Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) root are all herbs reported as anaxiolytic calming agents. Further, extracts of Magnolia and Phellondendron bark are mild sedatives. Supplements such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), theanine, tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) are reported to promote relaxation. In general, these supplements appear to act as GABA receptor agonists or to boost GABA levels, although Kava inhibits both norephinephrine uptake and sodium and potassium channels and 5-HTP may act through elevation of serotonin. While questions remain in the literature regarding the medicinal value of these supplements in treating mood and anxiety disorders, based on cellular and animal studies as well as human clinical trials the literature supports a role for these preparations as useful alternatives in the management of the stress and anxiety of everyday life.

Valerian,Early effect of NEURAPAS® balance on current source density (CSD) of human EEG - PubMed,"              Psychiatric patients often suffer from stress, anxiety and depression. Various plant extracts are known to fight stress (valerian), anxiety (passion flower) or depression (St. John's wort). NEURAPAS® balance is a mixture of these three extracts and has been designed to cover this complex of psychiatric conditions. The study was initiated to quantitatively assess the effect of this combination on brain electric activity.                  Method:                    Quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) current source density (CSD) recording from 16 healthy male and female human volunteers (average age 49 years) was used in a randomized, placebo-controlled cross over study. Recordings were performed 0. 5, 1. 5, 3 and 4 hours after administration of the preparations under the conditions of 6 min eyes open and 5 min d2 concentration test, mathematical calculation test and memory test, respectively. All variables (electric power within 6 frequency ranges at 17 electrode positions) were fed into a linear discriminant analysis (eyes open condition). In the presence of mental load these variables were used to construct brain maps of frequency changes.                  Results:                    Under the condition of mental load, centro-parietal spectral power remained statistically significantly lower within alpha1, alpha2 and beta1 frequencies in the presence of verum in comparison to placebo. Discriminant analysis revealed a difference to placebo 3 and 4 hours after intake of 6 tablets of NEURAPAS® balance. Data location within the polydimensional space was projected into the area of the effects of sedative and anti-depressive reference drugs tested earlier under identical conditions. Results appeared closer to the effects of fluoxetine than to St. John's wort.                  Conclusions:                    Analysis of the neurophysiological changes following the intake of NEURAPAS® balance revealed a similarity of frequency changes to those of calming and anti-depressive drugs on the EEG without impairment of cognition.

Valerian,[Manufacturing process of high quality phytopreparation on example of herbal sedative] - PubMed,"        Introduction:                    Rational phytotherapy is a modern concept of using plant-originated drugs which has emerged from the need to improve phytotherapy in order to make the use of herbal remedies more efficient and safer. The aim of this study was to give the health-care workers more information on the manufacturing process of high quality phytopreparation following principles of Good Manufacturing Practice and Good Laboratory Practice on the example of herbal sedative, Odoval S capsules.                  Material and methods:                    This study was designed to reflect the production process of a high-quality and safe herbal remedy, starting from defining the formulation and the production procedure to the quality control of raw materials, characterization of the final product, and testing stability of active ingredients in the capsules.                  Results:                    Formulation of the phytopreparation, validation of the production process, quality control and stability testing, all together have resulted in the production of capsules with defined valeric acid content (1 mg valeric acid per capsule).                  Discussion:                    The preparation is recommended to relieve the symptoms caused by chronic stress (anxiety, irritability, fatigue, lack of concentration, heart palpitations) and for mild insomnia.

Valerian,Initial exploratory observational pharmacology of Valeriana wallichii on stress management: a clinical report - PubMed,"              Valeriana wallichii, an Indian medicinal plant, has been on trial for its role in stress disorders in hospital based clinical set-up. Hamilton's Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) was used and thorough clinical investigations were carried out to screen the subjects. Thirty-three subjects (20 male and 13 female; average age 34.2 years) were medicated with the plant extract in a fixed dose regime (500 mg/capsule, twice daily, p.o. after meal). They were thoroughly investigated clinically and using standard questionnaires based on different psychological rating scale at baseline (day 0), mid-term (day 30) and final (day 60). The observations exhibited that, V wallichii not only significantly (p < 0.001) attenuated stress and anxiety, but also significantly (p < 0.001) improved depression and also enhanced the willingness to adjustment. Nevertheless it did not alter memory, concentration or attention of the volunteers. The results suggest that V wallichii may be useful in the treatment of stress related disorders in human and may be a promising anti-stress agent in near future.          "
Valerian,Blood pressure and heart rate of students undergoing a medical licensing examination - PubMed,"        Aims:                    To assess the effect of a real life mental stress situation on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) in students undergoing a medical licensing examination.                  Method:                    Prospective observational study of 121 medical students taking the final licensing exam. BP and HR were taken before and after the exam. Additionally, BP was measured by ambulatory BP monitoring device and HR was recorded continuously by an HR monitor belt in 25 students throughout the examination.                  Major findings:                    Diastolic BP (DBP) increased from 81 +/- 10 mmHg before the exam to 86 +/- 9 mmHg (p = 0.008) during the exam and to 88 +/- 11 mmHg, (p = 0.007) 15 min after the exam. Systolic BP (SBP) did not increase significantly during (from 131 +/- 14 before the exam to 136 +/- 18 mmHg) and after the exam (135 +/- 16 mmHg). HR decreased during (to 100 +/- 18 beats/min, p < 0.001), and after the exam (to 95 +/- 19 beats/min, p < 0.001) compared to values before the exam (114 +/- 19 beats/min). SBP was higher in male students compared to female students before (138 +/- 10 vs 125 +/- 18 mmHg) and after (126 +/- 18 vs 115 +/- 17 mmHg) the exam (p < 0.01).                  Conclusion:                    Only DBP increased during medical licensing examination, albeit within a small range. SBP did not change significantly and HR decreased during the exam. Male students showed a higher SBP compared to female students.          "
Valerian,Valerenic Acid Protects Against Physical and Psychological Stress by Reducing the Turnover of Serotonin and Norepinephrine in Mouse Hippocampus-Amygdala Region - PubMed,"              In a previous study, we demonstrated that a Valeriana officinalis extract could attenuate increases in serum corticosterone levels in a mouse model of physical and psychological stress. In addition, our results showed that the extract could modulate serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) turnover in the hippocampus and amygdala region. In this study, we intended to investigate the effects of valerenic acid (VA), the main component of V. officinalis extract, on corticosterone levels in serum in normal mice and monoamine turnover in hippocampus-amygdala homogenates in a mouse model of physical and psychological stress. To determine the minimum dose of VA for antianxiety effect, eight-week-old ICR mice were orally administered VA (0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg/0.3 mL) once daily for 3 weeks to probe for immobility time and serum corticosterone levels. At a VA dose of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg, animals showed a decrease in the duration of immobility time and serum corticosterone levels. To confirm the antianxiety effect of VA, eight-week-old ICR mice received VA at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, orally, once daily for 3 weeks, before being subjected to physical or psychological stress for 3 days, in a specially designed communication box, followed by estimation of levels of monoamines and their metabolites in the hippocampus-amygdala region. In conclusion, VA administration at 0.5 mg/kg can mitigate the physical and psychological stress response by decreasing the turnover of 5-HT to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and NE to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol sulfate in the hippocampus and amygdala.

Valerian,Over-the-counter medication and herbal or dietary supplement use in college: dose frequency and relationship to self-reported distress - PubMed,"        Objective:                    A growing number of researchers have examined the use of over-the-counter (OTC) medications and herbal or dietary supplements among college students. There is concern about the efficacy and safety of these products, particularly because students appear to use them at a higher rate than does the general public.                  Participants and methods:                    The authors administered surveys to college students (N = 201) to assess the frequency of use in the past week.                  Results:                    A substantial percentage reported using OTC medications (74.1%), herbal or dietary supplements (70.6%), or both concurrently (61.2%). Dose frequency of OTC medications was the best predictor of self-reported emotional distress in the past week. Higher doses of products containing pseudoephedrine or valerian were associated with self-reported anxiety.                  Conclusions:                    These data further reflect an increasing trend toward self-medication among college students. Investigators must conduct reliability and validity studies to evaluate the clinical utility of the measurement tool developed in this study.          "
Valerian,"Valeriana officinalis L. for conscious sedation of patients submitted to impacted lower third molar surgery: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled split-mouth study - PubMed","        Introduction:                    Anxiety is one of the components of patient stress in the dental office and is recognized as one of the main factors that negatively affect treatment. The control of anxiety can be performed through conscious sedation, for which benzodiazepine is the drug of choice in dental practice, however present side-effects.                  Objective:                    The objective of the following study is to evaluate the efficacy of Valeriana officinalis L. (Valerian) for control of anxiety during the third molar surgery.                  Materials and methods:                    A single oral dose of either Valerian (100 mg) or placebo was randomly administered 1 h before each surgical procedure to 20 volunteers between 17 and 31 years of age. Anxiety level was assessed by physiological parameters (blood pressure and heart rate [HR]) and the observation of signs. Descriptive analysis, Chi-square test, Friedman test, Wilcoxon test and effect size test were performed (P < 0.05).                  Results:                    According to the researcher's (80%) and surgeon's (75%) evaluations, the patients treated with Valerian were calmer and more relaxed during surgery. Valerian had a greater effect on the maintenance of systolic blood pressure and HR after surgery.                  Conclusion:                    Valerian was more effective at controlling anxiety than a placebo when used for the conscious sedation of adult patients submitted to impacted lower third molar surgery.

Valerian,GABA-modulating phytomedicines for anxiety: A systematic review of preclinical and clinical evidence - PubMed,"              Anxiety disorders are chronic and functionally disabling conditions with high psychological stress, characterised by cognitive symptoms of excessive worry and focus difficulties and physiological symptoms such as muscle tension and insomnia. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter within the central nervous system and is a key target of pharmacotherapies in the treatment of anxiety. Although current pharmaceutical treatments are often efficacious, they may cause undesirable side effects including cognitive decrements and withdrawal symptoms. Plant-based ""phytomedicines"" may provide novel treatment options, to act as an adjunctive or alternative to existing anxiolytic medications. As such, we conducted a systematic review to assess the current body of literature on anxiolytic phytomedicines and/or phytoconstituents. An open-ended search to 5 July 2017 was conducted using MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, and Cochrane library online databases and performed in a stepped format from preclinical to clinical investigations. Eligible studies must have had (a) in vitro evidence of GABA-modulating activity, (b) animal studies using anxiety models to test an anxiolytic effect, and (c) human clinical trials. Ten phytomedicines were identified as having preclinical investigations showing interaction with the GABA system, in addition to human clinical trials: kava, valerian, pennywort, hops, chamomile, Ginkgo biloba, passionflower, ashwagandha, skullcap, and lemon balm. Collectively, the literature reveals preclinical and clinical evidence for various phytomedicines modulating GABA-pathways, with comparative anxiolytic effect to the current array of pharmaceuticals, along with good safety and tolerability profiles.

Valerian,Effects of a fixed herbal drug combination (Ze 185) to an experimental acute stress setting in healthy men - An explorative randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study - PubMed,"        Background:                    Considering the negative effects of stress on health, there is a growing interest in stress-reducing interventions. The present study examines the effects of a fixed combination of valerian, passion flower, lemon balm, and butterbur extracts (Ze 185) on biological and affective responses to a standardized psychosocial stress paradigm.                  Purpose:                    The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of Ze 185 on cortisol and anxiety stress responses to acute psychosocial stress in healthy subjects.                  Study design:                    This study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind study with 3 parallel groups.                  Methods:                    72 healthy male participants were randomized to 3 groups (Ze 185, placebo or no treatment) during 4 days prior to a standardized psychosocial stress paradigm. Principle outcomes were salivary cortisol and self-reported anxiety responses to stress assessed at the fourth day.                  Results:                    The stress paradigm induced significant and large cortisol and self-reported anxiety responses. Groups did not differ significantly in their salivary cortisol response to stress, but participants in the Ze 185 condition showed significantly attenuated responses in self-reported anxiety in comparison to placebo (F(3, 41) = 3.33, p = 0.03) and no treatment (F(3, 43) = 2.77, p = 0.05).                  Conclusion:                    The results show that Ze 185 significantly attenuated the subjective emotional stress response during an acute stress situation, without affecting biological stress responses. Given that a circumscribed biological stress response is to be considered as an adaptive mechanism, Ze 185 reduces self-reported anxiety response to stress without affecting assumingly adaptive biological stress responses.

Valerian,Valeriana officinalis does not alter the orofacial dyskinesia induced by haloperidol in rats: role of dopamine transporter - PubMed,"              Chronic treatment with classical neuroleptics in humans can produce a serious side effect, known as tardive dyskinesia (TD). Here, we examined the effects of V. officinalis, a medicinal herb widely used as calming and sleep-promoting, in an animal model of orofacial dyskinesia (OD) induced by long-term treatment with haloperidol. Adult male rats were treated during 12 weeks with haloperidol decanoate (38 mg/kg, i.m., each 28 days) and with V. officinalis (in the drinking water). Vacuous chewing movements (VCMs), locomotor activity and plus maze performance were evaluated. Haloperidol treatment produced VCM in 40% of the treated rats and the concomitant treatment with V. officinalis did not alter either prevalence or intensity of VCMs. The treatment with V. officinalis increased the percentage of the time spent on open arm and the number of entries into open arm in the plus maze test. Furthermore, the treatment with haloperidol and/or V. officinalis decreased the locomotor activity in the open field test. We did not find any difference among the groups when oxidative stress parameters were evaluated. Haloperidol treatment significantly decreased [(3)H]-dopamine uptake in striatal slices and V. officinalis was not able to prevent this effect. Taken together, our data suggest a mechanism involving the reduction of dopamine transport in the maintenance of chronic VCMs in rats. Furthermore, chronic treatment with V. officinalis seems not produce any oxidative damage to central nervous system (CNS), but it also seems to be devoid of action to prevent VCM, at least in the dose used in this study.

Valerian,Studies on the cytological and biochemical effects of valerian in somatic and germ cells of Swiss albino mice - PubMed,"              Valerian is widely known for its use as a sedative and an anti-anxiety drug in the folk medicine. Literature reports suggested valerian to induce genotoxicity in vitro (ECV304 cells) by reactive oxygen species-mediated mechanism; however, there are no reports on its genotoxicity and/or the epigenetic mechanism in vivo. In view of the folkloric significance, it was found worthwhile to (1) determine the genotoxic effects of valerian in somatic and germ cells of mice and (2) investigate the role of epigenetic mechanisms. The protocol included the oral treatment of mice with different doses (500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg/day) of valerian for 7 days. The following experiments were conducted: (i) cytological studies on micronucleus test, (ii) cytogenetic analysis for meiotic chromosomes, (iii) cytological analysis of spermatozoa abnormalities, (iv) quantification of proteins and nucleic acids in testicular cells and (v) estimation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nonprotein sulfhydryl (NP-SH) in hepatic and testicular cells. The treatment increased the frequency of micronuclei in the polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) and decrease the ratio of PCE to normochromatic erythrocytes (NCE) in the femur. It caused aberrations in chromosomes of the testis and induced spermatozoa abnormalities. The concentration of nucleic acids was depleted in the testicular cells. These changes might be attributed to the epigenetic mechanisms as revealed by an increase in the concentrations of MDA and a decrease of NP-SH levels in hepatic and testicular cells observed in the present study. The observed changes may be ascribed to terpenoids (valepotriates) and flavonoids (6-methylapigenin and 2S(-)-hesperidin) present in valerian.          "
Valerian,Antinociceptive effect of Valeriana fauriei regulates BDNF signaling in an animal model of fibromyalgia - PubMed,"              The genus Valeriana has been widely used in popular medicine for centuries, to treat sleep disorders, anxiety, epilepsy and insomnia. Recent studies have focused on the novel pharmacological effects of Valeriana fauriei Briq. (VF) species. Previous studies have attempted to determine the pharmacological functions of Valeriana in various human diseases, particularly with regards to its neuroprotective effects, and its ability to reduce pain and stress. The present study constructed an animal model of fibromyalgia (FM), which was induced by intermittent cold stress with slight modification. Subsequently, the study aimed to determine whether VF exerts antinociceptive effects on the FM‑like model following oral administration of VF extracts. The effects of VF extracts on the FM model were investigated by analyzing behavioral activity, including pain, and detecting protein expression. In the behavioral analysis, the results of a nociception assay indicated that the pain threshold was significantly decreased in the FM group. Subsequently, western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses of the hippocampus demonstrated that the protein expression levels of brain‑derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phosphorylated‑cAMP response element‑binding protein were downregulated in the FM group. Conversely, VF restored these levels. These results suggested that the effects of VF extract on a model of FM may be associated with its modulatory effects on the BDNF signaling pathway in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. In conclusion, the mechanism underlying the protective effects of VF as a therapeutic agent against FM may involve the BDNF signaling pathway.          "
