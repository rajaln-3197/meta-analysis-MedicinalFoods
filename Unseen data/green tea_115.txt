              The flowers or leaves of Chrysanthemum boreale (Compositae) have been traditionally used as herb tea to reduce anxiety, insomnia, and stress. Sedative and anticonvulsant activities were evaluated in mice using pentobarbital-induced sleeping assay and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced convulsion assay. The flower extract exhibited more potent activities than the extracts of the leaves and stems, and chromatographic isolation yielded the five compounds acacetin, linarin, acacetin 7-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 2)[α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 6)]-β-D-glucopyranoside, chlorogenic acid, and 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid. These compounds were simultaneously analyzed by HPLC, and the method was validated. The contents of linarin, which were shown to be most abundant in C. boreale, were observed in the order of leaf (11.93 mg/g) > flower (8.50 mg/g) > stem (5.60 mg/g). Linarin and its aglycone, acacetin, exhibited sedative and anticonvulsant activities in the present in vivo assays. It can be considered that linarin is one of the active compounds effective against anxiety, insomnia, and stress, with acacetin as its active moiety.
