              In this study, we tested preventive effects of a natural medicine the extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGB 761) on post-stress cognitive dysfunction. Exposure to chronic restraint stress in rats and psychosocial stress in humans has been shown to alter cognitive functions such as learning and memory and have been linked to the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety disorders. Our findings indicate that chronic restraint stress impaired egocentric spatial memory as observed in the eight-arm radial maze but it did not alter the allocentric spatial memory in the Morris water maze. In control rats EGB 761 (100mg/kg, orally) improved spatial memory in these two tests. Also, EGB 761 normalized cognitive deficits seen in rats chronically stressed or treated with an 'equivalent' dose of exogenous corticosterone (5mg/kg, subcutaneously). We conclude that, in rats, repeated administration of EGB 761 prevents stress- and corticosterone-induced impairments of spatial memory.
